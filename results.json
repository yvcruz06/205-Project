Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 142, \u201cPreparing for Mars,\u201d I'm Gary Jordan; I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We have nearly 20 years of continuous human presence on the International Space Station. That's nearly 20 years of studying the human body, understanding systems, and fine-tuning operations, for how to conduct human spaceflight missions, not to mention the decades of human spaceflight missions and experience before that. A lot has changed over time, based on what we've learned, and a lot of questions have come up that are important to understanding how things will change when traveling to Mars. You might think, that's a lot of experience already, so why don't we just go to Mars. It's hard to imagine just how hard Mars is. It requires near absolute perfection, and any deviation may be a risk to the safety of the humans onboard or the success of the mission. So, the question is, are we ready? You can even ask, how ready are we? Luckily, we have an organization right here at the NASA Johnson Space Center, and all across the agency, looking at what we have and what we need to make a Mars mission successful. Michelle Rucker is a Mars Integration Lead at Johnson Space Center for the Mars Integration Group, a team that spans across all of NASA. She's a 33-year veteran of NASA, joining in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, and supporting the investigation by conducting booster material tests and analysis. She has participated in a range of exciting projects, such as the International Space Station Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, hypervelocity impact research, spacesuit and space walking tools, space station exercise equipment, system engineering, and Orion Crew exploration vehicle testing and verification. She currently leads the Mars Integration Group, developing crude Mars mission concepts. She holds two U.S. patents and has authored numerous technical publications. So, on today's podcast, Michelle goes over the details of what we know, what we have, what we need, and how NASA's Artemis Program, that will establish sustainable human presence on the Moon, will help inform and fine-tune the ideal mission structure for a Mars mission. And I hope you like this topic, because there's going to be a lot more. This month kicks off monthly episodes that are all about a Mars mission, and we'll call it \u201cMars Monthly.\u201d Over the next few months or maybe even the next year, we'll dive deep into the various elements we discuss today with Michelle. So, here we go, preparing for a human mission to Mars with Michelle Rucker. Enjoy.  [Music]  Host: Michelle Rucker, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Michelle Rucker: Thanks for having me.  Host: So, this is an interesting topic. I'm really excited to talk about how we're preparing for Mars. There's a lot to consider, and it seems like it's a pretty small group doing it. I want to get a little bit of sense of your background though, to understand what has to go into the people that are actively thinking about what we need for Mars. What's your background?  Michelle Rucker: So, I was born in Alaska. So, extreme environments don't scare me. So, that's probably the first requirement for thinking about Mars. I went to school here in Houston, at Rice University. I've got a couple engineering degrees in mechanical engineering. I started my career at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico.  Host: Oh, right at NASA. OK.  Michelle Rucker: With NASA, yeah. If you're not familiar with White Sands, we do all the fun hazardous testing stuff out there. So, that means blowing stuff up and setting it on fire and shooting micrometeorites at it. So, I spent the first part of my career trying to destroy spacecraft. But at some point, you get tired of that, and you want to start creating. So, I transferred here to Johnson. I worked on the space station with the life support systems. I did stints with the exercise equipment. That was one of the funnest jobs I did. I also worked with the Constellation Program, for both the Altair Project and the Orion Project. And then when the Constellation Program wound down, I started doing exploration for the first time. So, I'm relatively new, compared to some of the folks who have been working about -- working on Mars for years now. I've only been doing Mars work for maybe the last eight or nine years.  Host: That's still significant, but I think what's important is, you have a -- you have that breadth of experience. You did a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The space station is really important. We're going to fold that into today's story a little bit. So, I think that's a really good background to have. Now, you say you're new, but eight or nine experiences -- eight or nine years. That's a lot of experience, to me. So, just from what you've learned, in your eight or nine years, thinking even just all the way back actually, to when we first started here at NASA, thinking about Mars Missions and what we need from Mars missions. What were we thinking about?  Michelle Rucker: So, Mars missions -- the history within NASA is sort of interesting. Only a few weeks after the Apollo 11 landing, Wernher von Braun put together a proposal for a Mars mission, essentially taking the lunar hardware that he just developed successfully for the Moon, and supersizing it and going to Mars. So, that was an initial proposal. At the time, the agency was focused on the Moon. When the Apollo Program wound down, NASA focused a little bit more on low-Earth orbit. So, the shuttle and the station era, we were a little bit closer to home. But even during that period, there was a small office -- both here at Johnson Space Center and across the agency, there were small groups working on some of the Mars technologies, thinking about some of the mission concepts. To me, Mars is a system engineering problem, as much as anything. We know how to do most of the individual pieces. It's how do you put it all together, into a single mission concept, to be successful.  Host: I see. And that's where some of the work you're doing is coming in. It's taking all those separate pieces and thinking about them and actively putting them into what we're thinking about now, with what resources and technologies we have now, but thinking just further ahead and way further out.  Michelle Rucker: Yes. So, taking the technologies we have, looking at whether we need to supplement those with new technologies. Do we need to extend the technologies a little bit more? Think about operations. Operations have changed a lot over the years, Now, we've got the commercial players involved, and that's an exciting new development. So, things have become a little bit more streamlined. Some of the things, the way we did business, even for procurements, back in the shuttle and station days, we're developing new and faster techniques for doing procurements, so that's exciting, as well.  Host: OK. So, let's go right into it, thinking about those challenges for Mars, the things that are going through your brain all the time. What are we thinking about, when it comes to what to do, what to integrate, into a Mars mission?  Michelle Rucker: So, what's interesting about human spaceflight is the entirety of human spaceflight has literally revolved around the Earth. Everything that we did with the Moon, the Moon revolves around the Earth. Everything we did with the space station, with shuttle, we all -- it was all revolving around the Earth. In order to get to Mars, we have to change our coordinate frame of reference. We have to start thinking about revolving around the sun. So, first we have to chase Mars around the sun, to catch it. And then once we get there, Earth wasn't where we left it, so we've got to chase Earth back around the sun, to get home again. So, it's a bigger scope problem than the types of missions that we've been focused on. So, the challenges, I like to break into really sort of three pieces. There's the getting there, the living there, and the coming home. So, are you ready to step through the pieces?  Host: Let's do it. [Laughter]  Michelle Rucker: So, the getting there. So, the trajectory guys like to say that it's 2,000 times farther -- it's like the odometer reading -- to get to Mars and back versus trying to get to the Moon and back. And again, that's because both Earth and Mars are moving, so it's not just a straight line there and a straight line back. You've got to chase these planets around the sun. So, 2,000 times farther than the Moon. It only took us a few days to get to the Moon. You can go to the Moon and back in a week. To get to Mars and back, that is -- that's a little bit different. How long it takes -- the transit time -- is a function of when you go, where the planets are, relative to each other, at the time that you leave, and what kind of ride you're riding in. But typically, we're talking two to three-year mission durations. So, that's a much longer mission duration than the types -- even the longest expeditions we've done on space station to date. It's only been a year. So, these are very long missions that we're looking at. So, a long duration mission means you need a lot of stuff. You need a lot of food. You need a lot of oxygen. You need a lot of spare parts, a lot of consumable parts. And that means we need to launch a lot of stuff from Earth, or we need to figure out a way to either make it or find it somewhere, either at our destination or on the way. Once we get to Mars' orbit, we will need to land a fairly large payload. To date, the largest thing we've landed on Mars is the Curiosity Rover. It's about one metric ton. The smallest human rated vehicles we've been able to squeeze -- we're looking at crews of maybe four people. A crew of four is still probably going to require about a 20-ton, 20 metric ton lander, so that's 20 times as big as anything we've landed previously. And unlike Earth, Mars doesn't have a nice, thick atmosphere, where we can use it to help slow down. So, our entry descent and landing is challenging. The other problem with Mars is global dust storms. You may have read about the Opportunity Rover unfortunately --yeah, met with a tragic end, with the dust storm in 2018, I believe. So, dust storms can obscure the landing site. So, that's another thing. We need technologies that would be able to deal with that, or we need to plan -- have good weather prediction and be able to plan around dust storms. So, once you get there and land, then there's the living there. So, in some ways, Mars is a lot like home. There's a day and night cycle on Mars. A day's a little bit longer on Mars. It's about 24 hours and 37 minutes. It's got mountains. It's got valleys. I've seen photos that the rovers have taken, and it looks just like the desert Southwest in some places. So, lots of beautiful vistas.  Host: Wow.  Michelle Rucker: It has seasons. So, a Martian year is about twice as long as an Earth year, but it does have seasons. On a balmy summer day, it can be as warm as 80 degrees. So, in some ways, Mars is attractive, because it seems hospitable. It's also exotic. It's got two moons, Phobos and Deimos. If you\u2019re into Greek mythology, they were the twin sons of Ares, I believe. They're itty-bitty moons, but I've always thought it was kind of cool, that if you were sitting on a Martian surface, looking up at the night sky, the moons cross each other in orbit, which is kind of cool.  Host: Wow. That would be a sight.  Michelle Rucker: That would be pretty neat, yeah. But Mars is also challenging. So, it's got reduced gravity. Humans are used to 1G, and Mars is reduced -- if you weighed 100 pounds on Earth, you'd only weigh about 38 pounds on Mars. But because there is gravity, the challenge is that carrying around a big, heavy spacesuit becomes more problematic. We never worried about that too much in the ISS days, because with microgravity, a big, bulky spacesuit wasn't really a problem. But on ISS, you don't really walk. You use your hands to translate around. So, our spacesuits will need to be redesigned for a planetary surface. Once you get on the surface, humans are going to need a lot of power. Got to upload those selfies, right? You've got life support, communication, mobility, whatever science we're going to do on the surface, so we'll probably need a lot of power. The conventional wisdom is while we're in space, we just use solar, but Mars is a little bit further from the sun than Earth is, so there's reduced solar energy there. The other problem is the dust storms. The dust storms -- that's what happened with Opportunity -- the dust storm knocked out the solar energy, and poor Opportunity didn't make it. So, we need to look at some alternative sources for power. And it can get cold, in some places, in some seasons. So, it's a pretty extreme environment. So, now if we've finished up our mission on Mars, we're ready to come home, all of the Mars missions to date, all of our robotic missions, have been one-way affairs. We've never actually tried to launch anything from Mars. So, Mars does have a lower gravity, so getting something off the surface of Mars would be easier than getting something off the surface of Earth. But we still estimate about seven kilograms of propellant for every one kilogram of mass we're trying to get into orbit. Each crew member is going to be, you know, maybe 100 kilograms. So, you're talking about a lot of propellant. We've estimated up to 38 metric tons for a four crew with science equipment and their EVA suits and so on. So, that begs the question of, do we bring all that propellant from Earth, and then try to land it, or do we figure out a way to make propellent there? Those are some interesting questions. Once you get back into space, getting your deep space transport come back to Earth, you've got the Earth reentry problem. It's about 11 kilometer per second reentry back into Earth. That's what Orion -- that's the challenge Orion was designed to overcome. So, those are the challenges. And all of those taken together could be daunting, if you were trying to start from scratch, to solve all those challenges. But the cool thing about what NASA's been doing over -- ever since Wernher von Braun first proposed Mars -- is we've been whittling away at these challenges, piece-by-piece. So, we don't have to start from scratch. A lot of the projects that you may have heard about recently, Artemis, the Human Landing System, the Gateway, plus ISS shuttle experience, some of the EVA suit development work that's been going on, all of that will contribute to helping us solve some of these challenges.  Host: That's significant. That's a lot of consideration. I mean, that was -- what you just described, right there, that little packet, was the whole -- was the Mars mission. It was getting there. It was living there. It was coming back. It was in those three sections. And it's -- I'm smiling over here. You can't see it, because we're on the podcast. I'm smiling but, I mean, you make it sound like -- and that's it. And that's what we need to do. But I know it's so hard. There's a lot of challenges that are associated with this, in terms of what we're investigating. Let's kind of dive a little bit deeper into some of these challenges, starting with getting there. I pulled out a couple key elements, and as you were going there, you know, you're like, oh, that's a challenge. But I know it's like -- it's a really big challenge. So, one of them was just distance, just being far away is just -- makes everything so much more complicated, because with being far away comes -- you have communication delays. You're talking about a significant amount of energy to get there, a significant amount of time to get there, and then the positions -- like you did mention this -- the positions of Mars and Earth have to be in such a way that meet the requirements, to actually go catch up with Mars. That's all very significant things.  Michelle Rucker: It's pretty astonishing that there are smart guys who can calculate precisely where Earth and Mars will be at any given instant in time, with such phenomenal accuracy. It still amazes me. We actually rely on -- we've got a team here at Johnson, the [Mission Analysis and Integrated Assessments] MAIA team, that does a lot of trajectory analysis. We also use some folks at Langley Research Center that do trajectory analysis, and also, we've got some team members at the Glenn Research Center that help us with that. So, yeah, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out exactly who's where, when. On ISS, if you run out of something, it's pretty easy to resupply it. If you're halfway to Mars, it's a little bit harder. You can't really get supply on demand, so you have to do a lot of logistics analysis, predict exactly what you'll need when you'll need it. One of the cool projects we're working on right now with ISS, we're talking to them about using ISS to help refine some of our logistics models. They do really good tracking of what goes up and down, but because they have on demand, they don't have to necessarily predict very far in advance. We'll have to predict out up to two or three years in advance. So, one of the things we're doing is talking to them about -- let's start developing some models, to predict what you'll need on ISS, and then we'll look at actuals and see how close we came to that. So, we're using ISS today as a way to help refine some of the tools that we'll need for Mars later.  Host: Interesting. You're almost -- it's kind of like over-planning, you know. Like you're not just resupplying what you need on the space station because, as you mentioned, it's -- your time constraints aren't as drastic as Mars. So, let's just pretend that we're -- you know, we have to model what we need, what we will need, what we're going to run out of for the next two years. So, ISS is the perfect place to practice that.  Michelle Rucker: We're also using ISS as a -- we're in discussions with ISS to use returning crew members as a Mars analog. So, after six months in microgravity on ISS, physically they'll be in about the same condition as a crew that's about to land on Mars. So, we've been working with the Human Research Program to develop some experiments, where returning ISS crew members will do some simple tasks -- nothing that would be dangerous for them -- but just to try to understand what we -- what the crew could be expected to do on Mars. We obviously try to automate as much as we can, but if the crew needed to go do an emergency EVA, to go repair something, for example, the question is, how soon after landing would they be able to do it? After having spent six months on ISS, there's an enormous crew of people here on Earth that greets the returning crew and, you know, picks them up and carries them where they need to go and, you know, doesn't let them do anything strenuous for the first few days. They won't have that opportunity on Mars. They could potentially be asked to do things that they would never be asked to do here on Earth. So, we want to understand what the capabilities will be. Are there counter-measures we can use, to try to make sure that they're in good enough physical condition -- strong enough, with good enough balance -- to be able to do, not necessarily strenuous things, but things that could be dangerous, if you are far away from a doctor. You lose your balance and fall, for example. And yeah, so we try to think ahead to those sorts of things and use the available programs that we have in place today, sort of piggyback on those, where we can.  Host: Interesting. So, it's like you're trying -- you're using crew members returning to the planet, as a way to think about, if astronauts were on a very long journey to Mars, and you said -- what was it? It's nine-ish months to get there?  Michelle Rucker: It depends on when you -- which opportunity -- exactly when you leave, where the planets are, with respect to each other, and which propulsion system that you're using.  Host: That's an important distinction. But just, I mean, regardless, it sounds like it's going to be a relatively long time, about what we're doing now on the space station, give or take. So, when you land, I guess, what the human is going to be able to do, what we could do to try to -- counter-measures we can put in place, to see how we can maybe help them get ready to do something. Another thing that's coming to my mind is technology to maybe support -- maybe holding them in place for a little longer -- life support systems and the necessary provisions, so that maybe, during this recovery phase, they just need to wait it out. Maybe they have that ability. Because I know -- I mean, I've been out to Kazakhstan. I've carried an astronaut, and I know, they are just like -- I mean, but they get put right to work, right? So, they have to do these tests that you're saying right now, they have to do these tests to see -- to test performance. So, they're out there moving, but they are -- they're dizzy. They're dizzy, and they're -- they've had a long journey, and their bodies are adjusting. So, modeling that is important.  Michelle Rucker: So, that's one of the unknowns, is -- so, here on Earth, they don\u2019t have to get up and do anything right away. There's a crew there to help them. One of the things we want to know is how soon could they safely get up and do certain tasks without risk. So, that's sort of an exciting area of research, that we're partnering with HRP on. Back on the transit question -- how long does it take to get there?  Host: Sure.  Michell Rucker: So, one of the things that we're looking at is, can we minimize either how much propellent it takes to get to Mars and back, or the transit time, or both. So, we're looking at a range of new technologies. Electric propulsion is an interesting one. So, the Gateway will be using solar electric propulsion. Those electric thrusters are of interest. We sort of see that as the evolutionary path for the Mars system, so Gateway essentially becomes our test bed for that propulsion system. Gateway also -- the other thing that Gateway does for us is outside Earth's protection. So, it will give us some deep space experience, in a harsher environment than a little bit closer to Earth, with the radiation and so on. Long duration missions, that that was one of the challenge, because of the distance to Mars and back, you're looking at long durations. ISS has already given us the long duration human exposure to spaceflight, so we have a much better understanding of that than back at the time when Wernher von Braun first proposed a Mars mission. ISS has also given us a lot of long duration equipment experience. We understand, you know, the mean time between failure and certain types of systems. We're looking at regenerative systems, trying to be more self-sufficient. So, ISS has done a lot for the Mars concepts. The new commercial partnerships that -- some of the launch capabilities that we have available now that von Braun didn't have, if we do need to launch a lot of propellant to get to Mars, we have more options now than we used to have. So, that's exciting. Being able to land large payloads on Mars, we're developing and testing several different technologies. My personal favorite is the Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator. The acronym is the HIAD. That's a pretty cool system, to be able to use the -- it's a big, giant inflatable that gives you enough surface area to help slow down your payload before you land on Mars. The other thing Gateway will do for us is -- I always say that lunar landers coming and going from Gateway to the lunar surface will look very similar operationally to Mars landers coming and going to the deep space transport. So, Gateway will offer us an opportunity -- Gateway paired with the Human Landing System will offer us a lot of relevant operational experience that will be directly applicable to what we want to do on Mars. On the living there challenges, we already have a lot of experience with microgravity, which we need for the transit leg of the mission, from our shuttle and ISS experience, but the Artemis program will give us some reduced gravity, lunar gravity, experience on the surface of the Moon that will have some applicability. For example, spacesuits. We'll need to develop a planetary suit for the Moon, something that you can walk around in. The hip joints, the boots that we use on ISS are not really appropriate for walking around in a dusty environment. So, that's something that we'll get from the Artemis Program. And then surface power, we're looking at a couple options. Just oversizing the solar rays, more surface area, is one way to go. Another way to go is a compact fission power system. Our space -- our technology mission directorate is looking at some alternative power sources to solar that are of interest to us. The Moon is cold and dusty, just like Mars will be, so that gives us -- especially during the lunar night. It gets pretty cold, so Artemis will give us a lot of experience with the extreme environments. And then on the coming home again, we're looking at -- we're looking to the Human Landing System, the lunar ascent element may be directly applicable, getting from the lunar surface back up to Gateway is not unlike getting from the Mars surface back up to Mars' orbit. So, we're looking to that program for some -- maybe some get ahead on a Mars ascent vehicle. And then of course, once we get back to Earth orbit, or cislunar space, Orion has already solved the problem of getting the humans back to the ground again, so that -- we checked that off of our to-do list. We just rely on Orion. So, a lot of the challenges have been whittled away or have been at least whittled back enough that they're within reach now, for us to use for Mars.  Host: Yeah. I pulled out a couple -- because you went through those same three key areas, getting there and living there, and then coming back, I was thinking about things that were either -- we either have or are working on right now -- regenerative life support was one that I pulled out, because I know that's an important part of living and working on the space station, which we've been doing for almost 20 years now. And developing those technologies, that's just something that we have a lot of data, a lot of experience with, and is going to be needed for Mars missions, something that we have, but the one thing I was really looking forward to is all this Artemis stuff that you're talking about. You're talking about all these technologies that are helping us to get to the Moon, yes, but in a sense, there's a lot of applications, and important applications, for a Mars mission. That was one thing I think was -- it can't be really understated, because we talked about how hard Mars is, but this Artemis as almost a practice for Mars, and preparation for Mars and data -- data gathering for Mars. That's really important.  Michelle Rucker: Right now, we're thinking of the Moon as our test bed.  Host: Yeah.  Michelle Rucker: We will -- obviously, the cheapest place to test these things is on Earth, and we will test as much as we can on Earth. I'm sure my friends at the White Sands Test Facility are excited about doing a lot of hazardous testing out there.   Host: Yes, alright.  Michelle Rucker: So, we will test as much as we can on Earth, but at some point, you've got to get some relevant space experience. There's only so much you can do in microgravity. Microgravity helps us test the transit leg, but it doesn't really do much for the planetary piece of it. The Moon gives us that. It gives us operational experience, a lot of materials reliability experience. We're pretty excited about all the testing that we can do on the Moon.  Host: Yeah. Now, you're -- the group you're in and the work that you're doing is mainly -- is it informing? Is it advising? Is it actively thinking and writing down requirements for what you think we'll need for a Mars mission? Or what we think we should be working on now to prepare for a Mars mission?  Michelle Rucker: We're not quite to the point of writing requirements.  Host: OK.  Michelle Rucker: Well, with one potential exception. So, we've got the Habitat Broad Area Announcement, [or Broad Agency Announcement] the BAA effort that's going on. That was a procurement to look at an in-space habitat, which would potentially have applicability as the deep space transport habitat. So, that is one specific procurement where very high-level requirements have been defined. We're not quite to the point of defining requirements for many of the other systems yet, but we are developing concepts, concepts of operations. Being able to jump into requirements should go pretty quick, when we're ready to pull that trigger.  Host: OK. But you're thinking about at least the elements that you'll need. And we went through a lot of them. You just mentioned a habitat. I mean, one of the main parts of a journey to Mars is the actual journey to Mars, is getting there. So, there's going to be some form of a vehicle transportation technology, whatever, to actually transit from Earth to Mars, from Mars to Earth. So, thinking about what we might need to -- what that may look like, what we'll need to consider. Because it's a long time. It's going to be a long time. So, thinking about those things ahead of time is really important. And then another part that I pulled out besides your three, thinking about the technologies we have now and are testing, thinking about the technologies that are coming up for Artemis, another part that I pulled out was -- and this is a very important part -- the human element, thinking about what a person is going to have to deal with. And you already talked about the landing, considering a landing from the International Space Station, from low-Earth orbit, having that be a model for what a Mars mission would look like. It sounds like there's a lot of human components for Artemis, as well.  Michelle Rucker: Correct. Our team, we are so lucky. Don Pettit has been assigned as our crew rep.  Host: Wow.  Michelle Rucker: And he is -- he's so awesome. If you haven't ever googled his ISS YouTube videos, he is --  Host: They're fun.  Michelle Rucker: -- he is fun to work with. So, Don's been involved with us. Yes, we have been doing a lot of thinking about the human systems. Most of the -- a lot of the Mars focus of the last few years was with the science, with the Rovers, the robotic missions, the science missions. The human missions are completely different. The science missions have taught us a lot about Mars, about the conditions on Mars, what we can expect on Mars, and that is extremely valuable, to help us design for the human systems. But the, you know, the Curiosity is just a few watts of power. It doesn't really need very much power. Humans are going to need kilowatts of power. So, it's -- once you put the humans in the system, and you start trying to run life support systems and, you know, just the level of safety requirements that -- you know, you need to be sure. You need to have a Plan B and a Plan C. I always give my friends at JPL a hard time, because they're robots. They don't need food or water or bathrooms. And the human systems -- the humans will need all of those things. So, there's a whole new level of stuff that has to be thought about for the human missions, that the robotic missions never really had to worry about. It draws power. Once you have more power, you need more thermal control. Once you have more thermal control and more power, that's more structural mass. So, these things tend to snowball a little bit. And that's why our systems end up being much bigger than the robotic systems are. People always ask, \"Well, why not just send robots then? Why not just send robots? Do we really need to send humans?\" That is a debate that will rage for the ages. What the scientists will tell you is that the humans can do in a day what it would take the robots to do a year or more to do. So, yes, there's a compelling reason to send the humans. The humans can make real-time decisions. The humans can fix things that break. When poor Opportunity got caught in a dust storm and the solar arrays were covered, there was nobody there to dust them off. So, unless you've thought through that and planned for that contingency, with the robotics, that's the kind of thing that if a wheel gets stuck somewhere, the humans can get out and deal with that, whereas the robots can't. So, I can understand both sides of the argument. I happen to work on the human spaceflight side, so I'm a little bit more predisposed to that side.  Host: [Laughter] Sure, but I think maybe you might have a better appreciation than most for maybe living on Earth and what Earth has to offer, and things that maybe people don't consider when they think, why are we not on Mars right now? Let's go to Mars. You're like, no, it's really hard, because there's a lot of things that we're doing right here on Earth that are just -- we don't even recognize -- our conveniences are just -- they're, you know, I was thinking -- one thing I was thinking about when you were talking about a journey to Mars in the distances and bringing things with you -- I just did a road trip to Florida. It took me 17 hours. And yes, I packed the car full of waters and snacks. But I stopped for coffee, for a bathroom, for, you know, just to take a break, because I could. And I could get out of my vehicle, and I can kind of get more provisions, and I can use other facilities. And then I could get back in that vehicle, and I can keep driving. But that's not -- that's not a luxury, for a journey to Mars. I'm sure you have a better appreciation than most for this.  Michelle Rucker: So, being from Alaska, I have a very good appreciation of this. So, the reason I'm from Alaska is because back in the \u201850s, the U.S. government was trying to encourage more people to move to Alaska. They were trying to open up the economy there. And one of the challenges of getting to Alaska was it was really far away, and there weren't a lot of gas stations on the way. And nobody could really carry that much gas, to get all the way to Alaska. So, they offered homestead opportunities for folks who were willing to set up gas stations. And my maternal grandmother moved to Alaska, set up a gas station near Palmer, and that's why my family was in Alaska. So, for me, it doesn't bother me at all, to think about eventually setting up way points between here and Mars, to refuel vehicles. I know some people are overwhelmed by the sheer difficulty of that. It's hard, and it's dangerous, and it is. But probably no more daunting than it was to my grandmother, moving to Alaska, with a couple of kids in tow, and setting up a gas station, out in the wilderness. So, yeah, it's hard. But there are people here on Earth who are up for that challenge.  Host: You definitely have a better appreciation. It's even in your family. Just working on this and thinking about Mars and all the challenges that have to be answered and thought about before we actually go there, but thinking about some of the things that are in the near future for Artemis, and some of the answers that we might get, some of the questions that we might continue to -- that might continue to come up and that we might have to learn, what are you most excited about for this near future, going to the Moon and thinking about some of the things that we might be able to answer for a Mars mission there?   Michelle Rucker: I spent most of my career working with shuttle and space station, and those were really fun programs to work with. We were, you know, launching humans pretty often, and we were doing lots of interesting things. Going to the Moon is a whole different set of challenges. It's some of the same challenges as -- you still have to launch people. There's still danger and risk, and things above that, but landing on the Moon, that's a whole different set of challenges than going up to the space station. Working on the Moon, that's a whole different set of challenges. To me, that's the most exciting. It's the unknown unknowns, the things we don't know about. We learned a lot with Apollo, but those were very short missions. Being able to stay a little bit longer on the Moon, which is probably what we'll need to be able to do for Mars, it will just give us a lot of information. We'll learn what doesn't work, and I think that is almost as valuable as designing things that you hope work. Knowing what doesn't work is pretty important.  Host: That's incredible. Michelle Rucker, thanks so much for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast today.  Michelle Rucker: Thank you so much.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey thanks for listening, we have some bonus content for you at the end of the show so hang tight. First the credits. This episode was recorded on January 8th, 2020. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Norah Moran, Belinda Pulido, and Jennifer Hernandez. Thanks again to Michelle Rucker for taking the time to come on the show. I hope you liked this topic, because there\u2019s going to be a lot more. This month kicks off monthly episodes all about a Mars mission, we\u2019ll call it \u201cMars monthly.\u201d And over the next few months, maybe even a year, we\u2019ll dive deep into the various elements we discussed with Michelle today.   Host: Last month, NASA released a new podcast: NASA\u2019s Curious Universe. Our universe is a wild and wonderful place, and in this podcast, you\u2019ll join NASA astronauts, scientists and engineers on a new adventure each week. Take a listen. Padi Boyd (Host): Before an astronaut ever sets foot aboard the space station, they have to train somewhere you might not expect. [Deep plunge/cannonball splash sound] Padi Boyd (Host): This isn\u2019t just any old swimming pool, it\u2019s the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, located at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. This special pool contains 6.2 million gallons of water, enough to fit nine Olympic-sized pools inside. It\u2019s where astronauts like Nick come to train. Nick Hague: So, the pool is this gigantic pool. It's 200 feet long. It's 100 feet wide, and it's 40 feet deep. It is enormous. It's still not big enough to fit the entire space station in it, but it fits full-scale large chunks of the station so that we can practice. And that's our training ground. Padi Boyd (Host): The pool is where astronauts first get acquainted with the armor that protects them from space, their spacesuit! And that can be its own challenge. First thing. You\u2019ve got to suit up. It can take about 45 minutes and the assistance of multiple suit technicians to get the suit on \u2014 checking to make sure that every piece is fitted and working properly, from the helmet locking into place to the gloves fitting around every finger.  Nick Hague: You have to learn how to use the spacesuit, because it's not like wearing clothes. It\u2019s, constraining, and it limits some of the things you can do. It's fatiguing because of the pressure of having it stiff, and so you have to learn how to use it, and that takes hours underwater, getting to know your spacesuit.  Padi Boyd (Host): Once you have the suit on and it\u2019s been double, and triple checked, you can prepare to enter the Neutral Buoyancy Lab. Even though you\u2019re not out in space just yet, the pool will simulate what you might feel once you\u2019re out there. Why? Because being underwater simulates weightlessness. Nick Hague: The Neutral Buoyancy Lab is there to train us, because that's one of the places or one of the ways that we can try to simulate being weightless. So that idea of neutral buoyancy. Padi Boyd (Host): It\u2019s called \u201cneutral buoyancy\u201d because when you\u2019re in water and you don\u2019t sink but also you don\u2019t float, you\u2019re completely neutral.  It\u2019s like you\u2019re \u201chovering\u201d in place.  Nick Hague: And so, it feels as though I\u2019m weightless and I can maneuver myself around the outside of the space station and have the experience of working in a weightless environment. And so, we\u2019re constantly trying to balance out the weight of an object with its buoyancy so that things just float in front of you. Padi Boyd (Host): Weights and flotation devices are carefully combined to let astronauts feel what it\u2019s like to be weightless in space. When an astronaut is training in the pool, their backpack \u2014 the Primary Life Support Subsystem \u2014 is filled with air they can breathe and instruments that monitor their health.  Nick Hague: You've got to get everything straight because once you go underwater, that's all you've got are the tools you took with you. You're going to be down there for six hours. Padi Boyd (Host): That\u2019s about the amount of time it takes for a spacewalk in actual space. Once you\u2019re in the pool, waterproof instructions are attached to your arm, and you rehearse the spacewalk as if you were doing the real thing.  [NAT SOUND of TRAINING: \u201cAlright, Nick, before you get started on that\u2026. If we could just\u2026 help me guide that out\u2026 much appreciated.\u201d] Padi Boyd (Host): The whole time, a team of people is watching every movement of your practice spacewalk. They monitor the pressure inside of the suit and the temperature. And the test director is making sure that the whole process is going according to plan.  [NAT SOUND of TRAINING: \u201cGood teamwork there. Exactly\u2026.\u201d \u201cSo, I need to float a little bit higher on this end\u2026 alright, OK, so that\u2019s good alignment.\u201d] Padi Boyd (Host): Trained scuba divers guide you around a replica of the outside of the International Space Station. [NAT SOUND of TRAINING: \u201cyeah, looks good here. Yep, we\u2019re aligned down here.\u201d] Nick Hague: Having this full-size mock-up of the space station underwater allows us to, to essentially memorize where every handrail is, where every handhold is, and if I'm going to work in a particular location, on orbit, I will have seen that and understand that location on the ground.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 151, \u201cRendezvous with Mars.\u201d I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We're continuing our Mars Monthly series with Patrick Chai Ph.D, who humbly requested to be referred to as an aerospace engineer at Langley Research Center in Virginia, but most would call him a rocket scientist. Patrick hones in on the challenges and needs for getting to Mars. The journey from Earth to Mars will be long, somewhere on the order of nine months. And with that, comes a series of challenges, some complicated orbital mechanics, and a whole range of options that consider things like propulsion, duration, timing, staging, and more. Yes, thanks to probes and rovers of the past we've landed on Mars, but a human landing will be like nothing else before. The transport will have to be much larger. And with humans onboard, you're limited on the kinds of routes you can take to get to Mars. Sounds like a simple consideration. Yes, of course there will be humans, but it makes things a lot harder. Buckle up everybody and all aboard to the red planet. Here we go. The challenges and range of options on how to rendezvous with Mars with Patrick Chai. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Patrick, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Patrick Chai: Thanks for having me.  Host: This is a really interesting and intricate discussion we're going to have about what it takes to actually get to Mars. So, I might go a little bit off track. You are going to have to steer me to Mars in the right way. Tell me about your background and what got you to the path where you're thinking about Mars rendezvous?  Patrick Chai: Well, I haven't been at NASA very long. I started in the fall of 2014. I was a graduate student at Langley as well, doing some system analysis for different refueling options. So, I was a grad student. So, I got my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech. And Georgia Tech has a program at Langley associated with the National Institute of Aerospace, where grad students can, you know, be on-site there at Langley doing research with folks. And so, kind of gravitated me towards doing system analysis. So that's how I ended up applying for a job at the branch I am in, which is a space mission analysis branch. And once I started there, that's back when there was a big effort, defining what then was called the Evolvable Mars Campaign as part of President Obama's flexible path definition, you know, going to the asteroids and, you know, having multiple paths getting -- humans to Mars. So, I started doing a lot of the trajectory work for -- for the Evolvable Mars Campaign and doing the definitions of how, you know, all the different mission opportunities and how much propellant it would take if we have, you know, different payloads and things like that. So that kind of evolved into me kind of being the lead of the trajectory analysis team there for -- for all the Mars stuff and now I'm leading the Mars Integration Group here at NASA Langley. But I still want to do trajectory work because that's the most important. That's \u2013 the exciting things I like to do. Leading team is great, but it's like one of those curses, you know, you move up and become management and they don't let you do exciting work anymore [laughter].  Host: You have to delegate, delegate --  Patrick Chai: Yeah, exactly. It's hard man. Learning how to delegate is a hard thing to do.  Host: Yeah, especially when you want to do --  Patrick Chai: Exactly.  Host: You want to get your hands dirty.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: So, you mentioned, you've alluded to a few different things in your description of what you're thinking about. You're thinking about systems, you're thinking about trajectories, what are these different elements that you're considering when you're thinking how do we get to Mars?  Patrick Chai: So, you know, for what are we thinking about here. It's always, you know, sending crew to Mars right. So, we have -- we have a propulsion element that, you know, you need some sort of propulsion element to get, you know, your crew to and from Mars right, and the payload that you need to deliver. So, typically, you have a, you know, very traditionally you have a chemical stage and so, you have, you know, kind of like a regular rocket. You have, you know, fuel and oxidizer and, you know, they come into a combustion chamber and they combust and then you exhaust that out of the nozzle and that's how you push things. Right? And -- for Mars, you either pushing the Deep Space Habitat where the crew lives in or a payload which is what we call cargo, which is the lander that you need to land things on -- Mars surface.  Host: OK, so -- so you're thinking about the energy, the type of energy it takes to actually get to Mars --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: And what you're going to attach to that energy.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, and so, you know, you -- for the integrated stack, you have your propulsion elements, and you have a payload and you have to be able to get that -- all those things put together in orbit, and then you send that to Mars, and not only you have to send it to Mars, it has to have enough energy for you to come back too. So, you think about a big rocket, you know, as a reference, like a big rocket you're launching from Cape Canaveral, you know, that is very short distance that they -- it has to do comparatively to where we're needing to go to Mars. So, you can imagine the energy that it would need to go all the way to Mars, it's pretty significant.  Host: Yeah. So, what's the difference when you're thinking -- we're talking about the system level now, we're talking about what you need to actually build to get to Mars. What differs when you add the human element?  Patrick Chai: So, when you add the human element, it's kind of different, right? So, if you think about, you know, things we've sent to Mars, all the rovers and things like that, you know, those systems have a lifetime, right. But you know, it's electronics, it's -- powered by battery or solar arrays or what not, they can take a much slower route to Mars which's much more energy efficient, right. When you have a crew onboard, you have other considerations because, you know, if you have a longer duration in space, that means you have to bring more food, that means you have to bring -- you have to have a bigger space for the crew, you have to have exercise equipment for the crew. So, what -- what that actually translates to is you have more payload, you have more mass, you have to push -- you're pushing more things and that -- we call it the tyranny of the rocket equation. It's an exponential relationship. So, you add one, you know, you add one kilogram or one pound of payload. It's not equivalent to one pound of propellant. It's, you know, a much, much bigger amount. So, it can add up really quick. So, for a human mission and it'll be a little bit for the -- for the robotic too, you know, it's all about minimizing that payload mass as much as possible. And these rovers that, you know, that [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] JPL is sending to Mars, I mean, they are very slimmed down, even though they're very beefy and they're very reliable. But they are always looking for different ways to do, you know, manufacturing and fabrication of these components to minimize the weight because weight is everything in space.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, so I guess, does -- maybe this might be a ridiculous question, but does thinking about having larger systems to get to Mars change your trajectory or your possibilities of how to get there?  Patrick Chai: Um, it doesn't really change the trajectory.  Host: OK.  Patrick Chai: Maybe a little bit, but it changes the way you think about how to get to that trajectory. So, everything we've sent to Mars so far, you're thinking about these, basically, your traditional rocket, you know. And these are, you know, we're getting much, much more efficient with them, but they're very, I won't say rudimentary, but these are, you know, systems that we've -- we've been using for decades, right. And they have their limits in terms of how energy efficient, how much, you know, what we call specific impulse -- impulse that it can deliver. And specifically, we'll measure kind of the -- how much -- energy you can get out of the same amount of propellant. So, the higher you -- higher that explosive impulse is, the better your system at being efficient. So, your traditional rocket you're looking at maybe, you know, 300 to 400 seconds with a specific impulse and there's a whole, you know, derivation equations. I don't exactly know why they -- use seconds as the -- as the unit, but it falls out of the equation. But for a traditional chemical, you're looking at 300 to 400 seconds of specific impulse. And, you know, with starting to think about some of these other, you know, kind of lower thrust and higher energy propulsion systems like the solar electric propulsion or a nuclear electric propulsion systems that can get you up to, you know, 3000 to 4,000 seconds worth of specific impulse -- that increase tenfold. The drawback of that is you ended up having to stretch your in-space duration longer because it, you know, it naturally is a lower thrust propulsion system. So, that's always the battle, you have -- you have a low thrust and a high thrust system. A high thrust system kind of, you know, is a really big kick to get you out and you can do a little -- another kick to kind of slow you down at Mars. And that's relatively fast. Low thrust, you kind of -- just like putzing along, you know, for a much longer duration, but ultimately it saves you a lot of propellant. And -- it's a much more robust too, if you increase your payload mass by a significant amount. It's much more robust to be able to absorb some of that growth, so.  Host: Oh, OK, so there's a lot of different factors your considering.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And -- what actually we have been working on in the last three, four years is actually kind of marrying the two. We've been working on what we call a hybrid propulsion system. And it's kind of -- it has both components. It has a high thrust and a low thrust system. So, you use the high thrust when you're near -- planets where they are actually most effective. And -- you know, because you're -- you have to, you know, no matter what, you -- have a long duration transit out to Mars and back anyway. So, you might as well use some of that time to do some thrusting and do some maneuvering. And we've -- we found that the system that we've kind of, you know, been analyzing has some advantages and some disadvantages, but that's how all this -- and that's important, I think, from, you know, what we -- what we always harp on from our -- branch, the system analysis -- analysis perspective. We have to be able to understand the behavior of the system. Especially under uncertainty and under changing requirements in order to understand what you're actually selecting. You can't just say, oh, because we have this very, very tiny optimized point design, we're going to select this -- this propulsion option. Well, what if your design changes a little bit, you know, how sensitive you are -- your system is to that change, and we need to have a better understanding of all that before we make -- before we're able to make really informed decisions.  Host: So, I mean, a hybrid approach sounds very reasonable because you're considering the -- flexibility, naturally when it comes to spaceflight with flexibility comes mass. Now you're talking about two different propulsion systems.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, actually, it's -- it's kind of -- yeah, you know, it's actually less in terms of mass. It's more on the complexity side.  Host: Interesting.  Patrick Chai: In terms of mass, like, you know, given the same payload and the propulsion system, it depends on the trajectory you fly. The chemical is going to be the heaviest, and then the full [Electric Propulsion] EP up is going to be the lightest. But, you know, you trade time with that too, right? You know, the -- the big rocket will get there -- get you there the fastest, but the slow boat electric propulsion will get there, you know, much slower. So, we're trying to, you know -- so like, for instance, we have some planetary probes that are flying out there that uses electric propulsion, and then they've been very successful in doing that. But, you know, these things take years and years to get to wherever they're going. And so, it's great for the -- for the planetary probe, you know, because they don't really care about, you know, how long it takes to get there as long as they get there and do the science they need to do. But when you have crew onboard, you can't really use that as consideration, right? Because you have to -- you can't just say, oh, we're going to have, you know, we're going to take three years just to get to Mars one way, right. It's -- you know, it's a nonstarter because all the food and everything you have to bring. Unless we can figure out how to cryo-freeze people, I guess [laughter]. That would be a different ballgame [laughter].  Host: Wow. I mean, this -- that's one of the key elements here, we're talking about sending humans to Mars. And that -- with that you -- one of the requirements is -- is speed.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: You need to get there faster.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, you need to get there, you know, in a reasonable amount of time before all your consumables and things like that run out, right. Or you have to bring so much that you never even get started. Right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so that's always the challenge, right? Because you -- you know, with exploring, I always use kind of the analogy of Christopher Columbus sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, right. When they leave, they had -- there was -- there was no expectation that they have any sort of, you know, stoppage and things like that on, you know, during the voyage, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so, they're hoping that, you know, fingers crossed that they can get all the way to wherever they're going and resupply, so they are planning however long they -- were planning to sail. And, you know, at least -- the good news for us is that at least we know where we're -- our destination instead of going sailing into the unknown. But to kind of, you know, give you some context, I mean, Columbus sailed in, you know, the late 1400s. And they got to the -- I think the first trip they left the Spanish coast and got to, I think the Bahamas. That, you know, was like 6,500 kilometers worth of distance they traveled, you know, across the Atlantic Ocean in like 30 something days. If -- if you use that same distance they traveled as, you know, if you -- if you say, OK, that's the same distance that you know, from Earth to Mars. The Moon, which is the furthest humans has ever been, is only two and a half miles off the coast.  Host: Oh.  Patrick Chai: So, give you some scale [laughter]. So, on all human existence, we've only gone two and a half miles off of the Spanish coast.  Host: Wow.  Patrick Chai: And we're trying to get across the Atlantic Ocean to the new world.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And trying to plan for that. And -- and so that -- that kind of gives you that scale. And I think people, you know, think oh yeah, we -- you know, we -- because we sent probes, you know, and things like that it should be easy, but it's -- it's not at all because it's -- one of the most -- I think fundamentally the most challenging things. That's why we've been looking at it for -- since the Apollo time, right. Because it is that challenging.  Host: Well, tell me a little bit more about what -- what is so challenging about it when it comes to the orbital mechanics of it all that -- how you're limited with your opportunities, how, you know, you can't really turn around.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, so we are, you know, very much governed by what, you know, the mechanics and the gravity and -- I struggle a lot, you know, talking to just, you know, people, you know, like my family and things like that, like what I do, it's not easy to like, have them understand that. So, I like to use the -- the train analogy and, you know, imagine like, you have -- you know, miniature train sets or big train sets -- I don't really want to know what you want to play with. But, you know, Earth and Mars are moving around the sun, like -- like they are on train tracks, you know, circular or ellipsoid train tracks, right. So, it's spinning around, but they're moving at different speed. Right? So, your goal of getting from one to the other is you're -- you're standing on one of the train track -- on the trains, you know, moving with the train, and you're trying to throw an egg across to -- and have it land on the other train without it breaking. Right? And so -- so it's all -- it's not only do you have to like have enough energy to throw it. You also have to have enough energy to slow it down so that -- when it lands -- when it gets to the train, it doesn't, you know, just splatter, right. That's kind of like a basic analogy of how you, you know, what it takes. So, you can think about, you know, imagine like, if the trains are on, you know, opposite ends of the circle, right? You know, they're not in sync, right?  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: You're not going to be able to, you know -- you could, it would just take a lot more energy to throw and to -- you know, and slow down, right. And so you -- you're -- basically what we're doing with Mars in terms of mission opportunities is that we're waiting for the trains to kind of align itself to the proper, you know, proper orientations for us to kind of maximize the use of the velocity, the speed of our train, and maximize the speed, you know, on arrival of, you know, the Mars train kind of.  Host: Yeah, what you're trying to do is you're trying to limit how, how hard you have to throw this egg.  Patrick Chai: Right, you -- how hard you have to throw there, and you have to limit how hard you have to push back when -- when you get to Mars. I remember seeing -- it was a great video that Mythbusters did where they had a cannon strapped to the back of a truck and then they drove it at 50 miles an hour and they shot the cannon off the back and it kind of just fell on the ground.  Host: I saw that one. Yeah.  Patrick Chai: You're basically doing that at Mars, right? And because you want to kind of just like be the same relative velocity. Because you're moving fast compared to Mars, right? And you have to fire engines, you know, fire a rocket, your cannon, the other way to kind of slow down and drop in Mars. So, you want to minimize that as well, because that's all, you know, we call it delta V, change in velocity. And that drives how much propellant you need. That drives how much your -- your propulsion system has to be in terms of, you know, thrust and size, and all that and it kind of snowballs into this giant vehicle that you have to take to Mars. So then, you know, minimizing that is the goal, right? And that's why we have very -- these -- these very what we call conjunction style trajectory that kind of minimizes that energy.  Host: OK, so how often do those opportunities come up?  Patrick Chai: Typically, the Earth/Mars synodic cycle is about 26 months, so every 26-ish month, you get one of those opportunities. That's why, you know, for JPL, their rovers, they launch every two-ish years or so. So, this one, we have Mars 2020 now coming up this year, the last one was launched in 2018. So that's kind of the cycle that we have. Every 26 months or so we have these kind of conjunction opportunities.  Host: Now, is there a factor you have to add into this whenever you're looking at these opportunities for the fact that humans are going to be on this vehicle and that you're going to have to return at some point?  Patrick Chai: Well, yeah, that's always -- that's always the trick, right? People always think, you know, oh, one way, right. No, we have the, you know, it's -- it's a round trip. So, back to the train analogy. You know, once you get to Mars, you, you know, in order to minimize the energy coming home, you have to kind of again, wait for the train to kind of get back into the proper alignment for you to come home. So typically, a conjunction style full round-trip mission, you're, on average about 180 to 260 days, maybe up to 300 days, you know, out to Mars transit time. And you stay on the surface or stay at Mars for 300 to 500 days waiting for the planet to realign and then you come home on the same low minimum energy trajectory. So yeah, so you have a whole round trip about three years is typical, very, very typical. Now with different technology, high and low thrusts, those duration do fluctuate here and there a little bit. But typically, you're looking at 900 to, you know, 1100 days of total, what we call time away from Earth, because that's, you know, the days start counting when you push the button to leave Earth.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: There might be more time the crew has to spend near Earth to, you know, they have to launch, they have to get into the spacecraft. And get everything checked out before they can even do that. So, you have to kind of back that out even further to, you know, to get all the total crew time in space, which may be a little -- little more maybe 100 days more than -- then when the total Mars mission. Some opportunities, mission opportunities are a little shorter, some are longer because the Earth and Mars orbit are not perfectly circular around the sun. So, they do have variations in the -- in the distance. So, some take a little longer, some a little faster -- sometimes a little faster. So yeah, a lot -- a lot to kind of, there's just a lot of variability and -- and we have to -- we do have to take that into consideration. Because we've -- we've had -- we've gone into some, you know, bad rabbit holes and oh, you know, this mission opportunity is really, really easy. Let's design to that. Well, if you do that, then if you miss it, you can't go ever again, or you can't go for 20 years.  Host: You have to have some flexibility --  Patrick Chai: Right. Exactly.  Host: Design your system is to meet these different --  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And there's one of the things that we harp is, is we need to be robust with -- with our design, because we understand that whatever we plan, there's always a risk of slippage, like schedule slippage.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And -- we need to be robust to that. And that's a challenge, right? Because you're already designing -- designing a system that is, you know, at the hairy edge of the performance, and you're trying to get everything out of the system, you -- you already can, and if you try to build in robust into that, you know, it's -- it's a challenge, because it ends up being really big and bigger than it needs to be for -- you know, it's always the, you know, in every system analysis, and even aerospace -- actually not just aerospace, but engineering in general, there's this debate of robustness versus optimization, right. You know, optimizing, you know, onto the very, very, you know, you know -- being able to optimize to something versus being robust to changes, and then that -- battle is always been an ongoing, so.  Host: Yeah, because optimization is equal to efficiency, but robustness is equal to reliability.  Patrick Chai: Right. Yeah, exactly. So, you know -- and there's a balance to that. You can't, you know, go full bore on one way or the other. Right. And so, yeah, you know, you could theoretically design a vehicle to fly every single mission opportunity. But that's not realistic, right? Because you wouldn't end up -- you will be so unoptimized for every single opportunity that yeah, that you end up with a system that doesn't necessarily closes from other programmatic perspective.  Host: What a challenge. Oh my gosh.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: Now, what about launch opportunities, you know, launch slips happen all the time.  Patrick Chai: Right.  Host: It's just a regular part of spaceflight.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. So -- so that -- that is the other challenge that we talked to, you know, we talked a little bit about the additional time that you need to account for, right. So, you know, so if you know your -- your launch -- your Earth departure date, right, is certain, you know, to maximize your mission opportunity, you're going to plan for the launch slippage, right? So instead of saying, OK, the crew is launching three days before that Earth departure date, you're going to have to launch -- you're going to have to plan to launch your crew a month, two months before that, that way if this slips you can have that -- and we have a -- we have some folks in the agency who's done some fantastic work on -- launch reliability, and they've done, you know, some great analysis to show, you know, in order to get to a 99% probability of actually getting you to this particular date you have to backtrack and figure out how much -- how many days you need to plan to -- to launch. The launch window, basically.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: So, it's -- it's a little different than like saying going to the ISS or even back then the Apollo program where, you know, a little slippage, you end up -- you can -- you know, the lunar cycle is only 28 days, right? And so, if you miss that magical opportunity, it's -- you wait a month, and it's --  Host: You wait a month?  Patrick Chai: It's not you wait 28 months, or 26 months, right? So, it's, yeah, you have to be robust in that. But there's a limit to that, right? And because you don't want to say, OK, we're launching our crew six months in advance, and they sit around in orbit waiting for their opportunity to go.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: Right. And that's -- that's unrealistic. So, it's -- it's, again, back to optimize versus robust, this is the risk versus, you know, how risky you want to -- want to be right. Is your -- is a 99th percentile probability good enough? Is 90th? Is 70th? I don't know, right? That's something that, you know, it's -- a challenge for both engineers and the program managers to understand the risk and understand where we can absorb the risk and where we can't.  Host: Yeah. So, what you're doing is you're -- you're thinking about this -- this wide spectrum of possibilities. You're thinking about how early do we have to launch? And how -- how long is it reasonable for the crew to hang out in low-Earth orbit until they take that Mars injection burn and go to Mars?  Patrick Chai: Right.  Host: What's reasonable there? What are the propulsion technologies that we can consider and what factors into that kind of design? You're just thinking about this whole thing.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, and it's a -- it's an integrated system and campaigns look, right. And that's -- that's more so than just doing like the individual design for systems. And the other, you know, throw you another wrench [laughter]. You know, the longer you wait in orbit, the more your systems degrade, you -- you might have propellant which are cryogenically -- or cryogenic temperatures so they might be boiling off. So you have to top it off, and there's a whole host of discussions and -- on that and that's why there's, you know, there's some discussion about different orbits where you do your -- do your aggregation, different orbits where you do your rendezvous and things like that so that it's -- it's not -- LEO, the lower -- LEO lower-Earth orbit is great because you can throw a lot of stuff into it from a launch vehicle perspective because it's lower. But it's a terrible environment for a spacecraft to hang out long term, especially big spacecraft. The thermal environment is pretty harsh from all of the -- the radiation from coming -- actually reflecting off the Earth from a thermal perspective is not -- not great, but it's also a lot of orbital debris because all the stuff that's up there, so there's a higher chance of that. The benefit is that you're still in the radiation -- in the radiation belt so you're shielded from that. So there's -- there's a trade, you know, if you want to go higher orbit, which is sometimes our preference because you can get out of the thermal environment, you can see out of the -- the overall debris environment, but -- but you take the hit on the radiation for some of your system. But the benefit is that since we're designing a system to go to Mars, all of that system has to be radiation rated and protected anyway, so it's not a huge issue with the exception of solar panels, which do degrade in radiation environment. So, you don't want that to sit in the radiation environment for too long or else it degrades so that you can't generate enough power.  Host: So, where are some of those higher orbits that we're considering?  Patrick Chai: So, we've been talking a lot about orbits around the Moon -- yeah, orbits around the Moon. The Honors Program is you know, with the -- with the Gateway had -- is out there in a -- in a near rectilinear Halo orbit around the Moon. We have these Lagrangian points that a lot of folks are very interested in understanding and -- and what -- what those points really are is you think about from gravity, you know, pulling each other at the Earth and the Moon are in a gravitational pull system. So, the Lagrangian points are just points in the Earth/Moon system that are -- that the gravity between the Earth and the Moon is relatively equal. So, you're not really being pulled by the Earth, you're -- you're being pulled by Earth and the Moon roughly equally. And so those are -- those are points of interest because it's a -- you know, once you get into those points, you know, it's easy to kind of get out of them. And so, you know, if you have a bunch of stuff stacked there, it doesn't cost a lot of energy for it to go -- to leave that orbit again to go somewhere else. And so it's great for our aggregating a lot of -- a lot of things and so, for, you know, what we've been looking at last couple years, with the assumption is always that we would launch all of our elements and components into that, you know, kind of like, we call it -- we just call it cislunar orbit, lunar orbit, just to be generic because we haven't really picked a particular orbit that we want to be in. It could be the same one that the Gateway is at that way we can have some synergy with that program.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: But we aggregate all that stuff there. But before Earth departure, you don't really want to depart from that particular orbit. Because you do --  Host: Lagrangian linear --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: -- Orbit? OK.  Patrick Chai: You don't want to -- you could depart from those, you know, those Lagrangian orbits but you have -- you get a much more benefit from the Earth's gravity if you're leaving from a, you know, Earth orbiting gravity or Earth orbiting orbit. So, basically, what you want to do is you want to come back and kind of swing by the Earth on your way out, that would be much more efficient to be able to do that. So, the assumption is always we come back to a high-Earth orbit. We call lunar distance high-Earth orbit. So, it's a big, big orbit that comes by the Earth and it comes -- when it goes out -- so orbits are always defined by perigee and apogee, a perigee that is closest to the main body and apogee is the distance furthest away. So, your perigee is close to the Earth, but your apogee is actually at lunar distance. So, a lot of our trajectory we -- we've actually been doing a lot of analysis and building a lot of these very intricate trajectory for -- for how we do Earth departure. To try to minimize the energy we need. Right? Typically, you know, when you do your -- what we call the Trans-Mars injection burn so burning for Mars, you come by Earth and you fire on your -- your rocket engine and you burn really hard and you -- you kick out there, which is great and it's fast, but it takes a lot of energy, takes a lot of propellant. So, we're -- you know, when designing our hybrid low and high thrust combination type of propulsion system, we're trying to minimize how much of that chemical burn that we have to do. So, we would design up these pretty intricate trajectories in which we come back into this higher Earth orbit, where the apogee is at lunar distance, and we phase it so that after the crew gets onboard the spacecraft, we target the Moon, we do a lunar flyby and -- and that kicks us out to heliocentric space.  Host: Oh interesting.  Patrick Chai: And then that gives us enough energy to go out. And that -- this only really works for the -- hybrid because technically once you get flung out by the Moon, you don't have enough energy to get to Mars yet. But with the low thrust you can then use the time you have in space to thrust and to kind of keep pushing and pushing harder, and harder, harder for you to catch up to Mars.  Host: OK, so this Moon slingshot thing works only if you have the high -- the solar electric propulsion.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, electric propulsion.  Host: Give you the extra boost.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. So, and because -- yeah, or else, you know, this orbit, if you just slingshot around the Moon you don't have any more propulsion, you eventually fall back into Earth in little like -- like maybe like a year later you catch back on Earth again. But so, you -- you go on a little tour of the -- of the Earth orbits area but you don't -- yeah, you don't -- you're not really going anywhere particularly -- in particular, so.  Host: Yeah, so -- so that brings up a good point. So, let's say for whatever reason you do that Mars or that Moon slingshot, but your solar electric propulsion doesn't kick in. Now, you got to swing back. You're hanging out in space for a year.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. Yeah, that's always the challenge.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: Well, you know, there is this quote unquote, \u201cabort.\" I think people, you know, like, you know, not their fault. Like, when people say, abort, you know, everybody have a good understanding what that is, right? Because we have all these abort scenarios, like, you know, oh, you're coming back home pretty quickly, and things like that. But yeah, man, when you're in heliocentric space it's -- it's not that simple. It's -- and it's -- it takes a lot of energy to come -- to turn around and burn home. For your -- kind of like a low thrust, you just do a lunar gravity assist. Let's say your scenario, your electric propulsion system just craps out and doesn't do anything. The benefit is that you still have your chemical propulsion system. So, you could theoretically -- and you're not -- you're -- in terms of your overall energy, you're not that far from Earth. We haven't really done the analysis to understand how quickly you can get back. That's really, really dependent on the orbit of the particular date you're looking at, and things like that. But we do have some analysis done on the high thrust side of things, you know, after you do your big burn can you -- you know, I guess in those scenarios is like, oh, if a crew has some issues and need to come home, how -- what are the options, right? And, honestly, it's pretty limited, even with like, you know, this is one of the benefits of -- people have touted for the nuclear thermal propulsion system which has is -- it's kind of like a -- it's kind of like the chemical but instead of combustion in the -- using the propellant, you're using a nuclear reactor to, you know, heat up the fuel and expand it out. So, it has a higher specific impulse. But you have to carry a nuclear reactor around which has its own challenges. But they talk about these abort scenarios because -- because it has the efficiency that -- that the chemical system doesn't have, but that's still, you know, once you kick out and especially those high thrust trajectory, you're much, much higher energy. So, in order for you to turn around and burn back this -- burn back towards Earth, it's not a straight shot, you know, it's not like me, you know, doing a U turn and coming home. There's -- there's no -- U turn really to be done. You almost have to burn enough so that you fly by -- you do a really close swing by of the sun and come back and catch back up on Earth -- with Earth again, and that -- that could take you know, a year or so, or six months. Depending on when that burn happens, so the challenge we've always had when -- when these type of questions come up is, in what scenario do you have a crew, I guess, crew health situation where, you know, the full, you know, Mars mission three years round trip is not acceptable, but a six months, one year return is acceptable, right? What -- what scenario are you thinking about? Because, you know, I always say, I don't know what the scenario is, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so that's -- that's the I think that -- and it's important to have that discussion. Because we need to understand where these questions are coming from, and the people's concerns about -- about all this and understanding, like the scenarios in which they want to protect for and this is, again, back to the risk thing, right? If we want to protect for certain scenarios, we can run the analysis to show what it would cost, right and then it's up to the decision maker to, you know, weigh the cost benefit analysis. Say do we want to protect for this one or not? What are the probability of this actually happening? And -- we from a system analysis perspective need to show, you know, OK, if you want to protect for this risk here are the implications and how that -- you know, how that system change impacts the rest of the other systems that are related, right.  Host: Yeah. This goes back to what you're thinking about, which is this wide range of possibilities. Thinking about propulsion technology, when you're thinking about possible trajectories or in the orbital mechanics of it all, how to design a mission profile, however long it may be. That's a, you know, they're all worthy discussions to have. But I think we're -- really what it comes down to is a mission to Mars is a risk, you know, like --  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: You can't make it risk free.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: That would be amazing, but it's just not the way it is.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. It's like going skydiving, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: There's some inherent risk in that and there's nothing you can do to remove all the risk, right? And so, we can sit here and talk about, you know -- and engineering design system to be as risk free as possible, but it will not be zero percent risk, right? I mean, inherently, I mean, just getting on the rocket and going into space is probably the riskiest part of you know -- could be one of the riskiest part of the whole endeavor. Right? And so, at some point, we are -- we will -- we have to be willing to take risk, right. And I think one of the challenges we have as an agency, especially when it comes to the Mars program, is that number one, it's -- it's so challenging, right, we've kind of established how difficult it is. So, we need to have these hard discussions about risk, and cost, and schedule, and programmatics, and things like that. But -- but it's -- it's also double challenging because it's so far away always it seems like.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: Right? It's hard to make decisions now, the hard decisions that might not have impact till 10, 15 years down the road.  Host: Let's talk about the Moon to Mars. What we're -- what we're striving for right now.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: You already mentioned a little bit about the Artemis program and what we can learn about the near rectilinear Halo orbit and some of the technologies needed for Gateway. What will that help inform when it comes to some of these propulsion technologies and some of the ways that we're thinking about how the Moon can help us get to Mars?  Patrick Chai: Yeah, from the propulsions perspective, I mean, that's one of the benefit, right, what -- you know, for the -- you know, what we -- what we've been looking at the -- the sub cam hybrid is that the electric propulsion thrusters that we are, you know, that we're planning on potentially using for Mars transit is -- being planned for the Gateway as well. Right. And so, there are some synergy there. And there's some, you know, obviously, there's -- will be some challenges with the development cycle because the power level is totally different, right? But there's, you know, you kind of draw a little family tree back up to that -- that particular design. I think the big thing for the Artemis program is kind of how the private -- private public partnership is kind of, you know, unfolding in front of our eyes. I think getting kind of the framework for this -- for this private public partnership as part of the Artemis program, understanding how we can leverage a lot of things that are happening in the -- in the industry -- in the private sector, can really inform and really drive how we think about designing the mission and think about how we either procure or leverage all the things that are happening and, you know, obviously the private industry have quite different objectives compared to what the government and NASA wants to do. We want to explore, we want to, you know, expand our knowledge and -- really drive and push the technological boundaries. And so that part is -- has to be the forefront of what we -- try to plan for. And I think we are. But I think the industry in terms of their push for innovation in areas that the government might not be interested in is also very beneficial because they are very interested in streamlining the manufacturing process, being more efficient with their design cycle and -- how robust their systems are in the way they do their testing.  Host: So, a lot we can learn from the commercial way of operating things --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: Implementing commercial partnership.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, you know, just under -- having synergy with a lot of things they're doing and leveraging some of the stuff they're -- leverage -- having just -- just dialogue and just understanding how they're doing their, you know, business model, if you want to call it and how we can learn from that, right, and change the way we're doing testing and doing developments and things like that. You know, in all industry and in tech in particular, you know, you need to have these kind of breakthrough and these industry kind of breaking, you know, moments, right, and to kind of drive us out of these kinds of complacency that we're in. And, you know, at some point, we got to decide, yeah, we got -- we want to go to Mars, and we want to be able to do certain things, and we just have to, you know, push for it.  Host: Yeah. So, it's that there is a balance I feel between innovation, you know, trying new things and doing things a certain way and maybe the tradition does have a certain benefit of precedence.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: It informs what is possible because --  Patrick Chai: As long as we learn from our history, and we, you know, we learn from the mistakes we've -- made, right. You know, I struggle with that every day, you know, make sure that I think this way, is it because I'm being informed by data and -- and I'm being informed by -- by good sound analysis, or am I, you know, leaning this way because of my, you know, inherent bias or inherent perception or preconceived notion of what the system is. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And that struggle is -- is, you know, is -- real at all levels. And that's something that we have to be kind of very cognizant of.  Host: Yeah. So when you're thinking about solving these problems with team members, finding a way to think efficiently and making sure that you're considering all of these different things, but not getting too bogged down by these decisions, that -- that's a balance just in and of itself, not just -- not just designing these trajectories and thinking about these systems, but coming to a consensus on how to proceed.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, it's great that we, you know, our branch in particular have had, you know, every, you know, year or so, we get one or two new hires, and we have a bunch of interns that come in. So, it's always great when they come in with fresh perspective. They have not been in the mud, you know, making these trajectories or analysis and things like that. So, they come in and say, \u201cwait, why did you do it that way?\u201d And we go, \u201cyeah, why did we do it that way?\u201d And we need that, right? Because, you know, you don't want to end up in a -- in a kind of an environment in which new people coming in, you know, are conforming, you know, you -- they're expected to conform to whatever standard you have. You want them to come in with a fresh mind, with critical view and to provide us with a different perspective. And that's, I think, the most valuable thing we have, especially here at NASA because of, you know, our notoriety and people want to come to work at NASA and it's a great thing. And we need to keep hiring, we need to keep these people coming in and young minds and -- and really get them engaged, not just in school, but you know, before. So, I think a lot of the public outreach things that we do is extremely important. I think NASA is still one of the most sought-after thing. People say, oh, you work in NASA? That's amazing. And -- and it is. You know, I'm thrilled to go to work every day. And -- and we need that kind of enthusiasm, you know, to continue for -- and people coming in are, you know, they're brilliant. And you need to be -- make sure that we are doing the right thing and doing -- doing things that, you know, to make them feel like they're empowered to change the status quo.  Host: Yeah. So thinking about what we've discussed today, thinking about the difficulties of rendezvousing with Mars, and with the different technologies that we're considering, reaching out to those people who want to come work at NASA and -- and fight to innovate and fight to change the way that things are doing, what are -- what is the message that you want to send to them?  Patrick Chai: It's -- you know, it is a very exciting time, right, because -- because we have this whole Moon/Mars enterprise now, the Honors Program is spinning up and we are going to, you know, go to the surface of the Moon to -- to do some very exciting science and with the goal on the horizon of always going to Mars. So, these systems that we are developing and partnering with, you know, industry partners to develop are going to set -- lay the foundation for what we do at Mars, right. And so, it's very important for us to not only do the mission to the Moon, but also be very, very cognizant of that these are laying the stepping stones. So, we need to learn as much as we can, as we do these things, to inform all the things that we're going to be planning on doing when we, you know, build a spacecraft to go Mars, right. And so, I think it's -- it's a very exciting time for NASA.  Host: Well, it's an exciting time. And the future is -- is exciting, because I think every year is just going to be -- is another step closer.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And -- and, you know, like I said, I think throughout this podcast is it's a challenging problem and it is probably one of the -- one of humanity's greatest challenge, you know, and I think if there's a will we, you know, I don't doubt that we can achieve it. But it is a challenge and -- and we have some of the brightest people on the planet trying to solve it. And, you know, it's a great thing, and it's -- it's something that, you know, I think it's going to be so rewarding for all of humanity. It's one of those, you know, you think about what people talk about, you know, well what does NASA do besides sending people to space? We do these innovations that we have to develop so that we can send people to Mars. They will have a long-lasting effect on our society. And we might not know what that is till years later, but it will. And that's kind of the challenge from a \"PR perspective\", right? You know what, you know, costing X amount of dollars to send people to Mars. So, what does that, you know, we could spend that money here on Earth, but it's like, you don't know what you're going to get out of it. But we know that it's going to be impactful because we have -- we have a track record of -- of all the great things that have spun off from NASA technologies that we've, you know, came out of the lunar program and the space station program. Right? And the Mars program will be an exponential in terms of how challenging it is, right? We're only two and a half miles off the coast of Spain right now. We're going all the way to America, right? And so, they will -- whatever we come up with in terms of solutions and technology advancement will be, I think societal changing.  Host: Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're on the team thinking about this [laughter]. And looking forward to bringing on others to continue it. It's going \u2013 it\u2019s been great work.

Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 160, \"Packing for Mars.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Our Mars Monthly series continues. Last month we chatted with Paul Kessler who described the deep space transport, or the Mars transit habitat, a little bit about what that may look like, and its important segments. On this episode, we'll be focusing on what we need to pack inside of that transport. They'll of course need things that you pack on a normal road trip, food, water, clothes, but this road trip will be a doozy. You'll need to bring breathable air, running on super reliable systems, and enough spare parts to carry you through a multiyear mission, because there's nothing that you can forget. Once you leave for Mars, there's no turning around and no resupply vehicles to send afterward. So here to go into detail on what to pack for Mars is Chel Stromgren, Chief Scientist of Binera Incorporated and part of NASA's Mars Integration Group. If you ever need help packing for a road trip, this is the guy you'll want to call. Pack your bags and don't forget anything. We're going to Mars with Chel Stromgren. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Chel Stromgren, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Chel Stromgren: Oh, good morning. Thank you.  Host: Alright. Very glad that you can come on. I'm very interested in this topic. I feel like if there was anyone that could help me pack for a road trip, it would be you.  Chel Stromgren: Yep, we've got a lot of experience planning for packing.  Host: [Laughter] Well, I'll tell you, it's got to take some background to get to this point where they're going to you and trusting you to pack for Mars and think about all the different things that you're going to need on this journey. Tell me a little bit about yourself, your background, your education, and some of the stuff you've done for NASA.  Chel Stromgren: Sure. Sure. I got to NASA kind of in an unusual route. Undergraduate, I majored in and got my degree in naval architecture and marine engineering. So, similar kind of challenges. You know, I was doing ship design, designing large cruise ships, navy ships, and I did that for a few years. Then I went back to graduate school at MIT and shifted a little bit into an area called systems management, which was really focusing on, you know, how do we take these complex systems like ships or spacecraft, how do we manage them in the most efficient way. How do we run them? How do we operate them? And a big part of that was looking at the logistics required. What are all the supplies we need? What are the spare parts? You know, how do we repair them over time to maximize the value? So, after doing that, when I got out, I was working for a number of customers, but NASA was obviously, you know, had a huge need in this area to plan space missions. So, I slowly got more and more involved with NASA and now, you know, I work as part of a team that really does, you know, all the logistics planning for these long-range missions.  Host: Alright. Well, tell me a little bit about what goes into that. When you're planning for a long duration mission, what are those key things you have to really bring in the front of your mind?  Chel Stromgren: Sure. Maybe I can use an analogy here. So, imagine you were going to take a road trip and it was going to be a three-year road trip in your car, but here's the catch, you can't stop along the way. You can't stop at a gas station. You can't stop at a Target. You can't stop at a hotel. You can't even stop at an auto parts store. So, everything you're going to possibly need for that entire three years you've got to bring with you at the start. So that's all the food you're going to eat, all the water you're going to drink, all the clothes you're going to wear, all the toothpaste you're going to use, and everything you need to keep the car running. Right? So, any spare parts, any tools, that all has to be packed. And then anything you're going to do along the way, any science, any exploration, any cameras. So, my job is essentially to figure out how do we do that? What do we need to pack in that car to start the road trip so we can complete the entire trip without any problems? And then to do that, of course, because this is space travel, with as little mass and volume as possible.  Host: [Laughs] Just that added little complexity there, huh?  Chel Stromgren: [Chuckles] Right. Exactly.  Host: Alright. So, tell me about some of those challenges, right? So obviously that's a challenge just in and of itself. I'm trying to image what that vehicle would look like on the road if I had to bring all of that stuff for three years. And I've got to say, if you're talking about bringing something small and light, I mean, that's a very difficult challenge because naturally I'm thinking something real big that's going to fit all of those things.  Chel Stromgren: Right. And that probably is the biggest challenge, because you know one way to approach this is just to be really conservative, right? You know, just pack a whole bunch of food to make sure we have enough, but as you said, you know, in a spacecraft, that's not really possible, especially when you're going to Mars, right? You've probably, with other people, heard this term, \u201cgear ratio,\u201d right? The gear ratio, which is how much propellant we need, you know, versus how much mass we have to push is really high. So, it's really imperative that we keep the mass down. So, we can't just be conservative. We can't just say, \"Yeah, we'll pack so much food, they'll never run out.\" Instead what we have to do is we have to look at a whole lot of historic data. You know, one of the huge advantages we have in my area is, you know, we have the International Space Station. And the International Space Station is probably the greatest possible laboratory I could hope for because, you know, we're doing it all the time. So, we can look in detail at how food is consumed aboard the International Space Station, what the variability is, you know, for different astronauts. And then working with others, like the NASA food lab, we can look at, you know, different levels of nutrition, what's required, what's the lifetime of different food items. So, we bring all that data together and we can actually build a probabilistic model of consumption rates, of, you know, different nutrition needs, lifetimes. And that lets us plan out, you know, in detail exactly what we'd need to bring in terms of food. And then we do similar things, you know, for all these other areas, for all these other packing, you know, clothing, hygiene supplies. And then, you know, because it's a spacecraft, even things as simple as water and oxygen, you know, we have to bring those with us. So, all those things get analyzed in detail. We build these models and that's really what allows us to kind of find that sweet spot of enough that we're going to be safe and healthy, but not so much that we're going to kill the mission.  Host: This is perfect. You're describing all these different considerations we have to think about and the ISS as a perfect model for thinking about that. But let's go into some of the challenges. What is this challenge that's presented in front of us for getting to Mars? I'm talking about the duration of the mission, the distance of the mission. What are the things we have to think about for a Mars mission?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. And really the biggest challenge there is how long we're away without any kind of resupply. So, you know, the ISS, although it's been flying for over 20 years, we've never gone more than 120 days without resupply. We fly these cargo vehicles to ISS all the time, Cygnus and Dragon. So, you know, if we find out we're short of something on ISS, you know, it's never more than 120 days or usually less that we have to go without it. You know, the real challenge for Mars is, you know, some of these missions we're looking at can be up to three years long. So, you know, it's just that shear duration that makes it so difficult. And I'll give you an example, one of the biggest challenges we have is spare parts for the spacecraft. You know, the spacecraft is really complex and there's lots of things that can break. And although we understand the reliability of different things, it's really, really difficult to predict exactly what may break on the mission, right? It's kind of a probabilistic type of situation. So, we have to be able to figure out, you know, based upon the projected reliability, which spares we might need to bring to cover that entire three-year period. Because again, I can't stop at the auto parts store along the way. So just that shear duration and the isolation from Earth makes it absolutely imperative that everything is loaded up front. And it takes a lot of complicated analysis to even begin to try to figure that out and a lot of data. Again, you know, ISS is really key here. And, you know, for us it really benefits us to look at systems that are very close to ISS in nature so that we can take advantage of that 20 plus years of operational data to understand, you know, well how often do different parts fail. You know, what was the result of those failures? What was the best way to fix them during the mission?  Host: So that kind of informs when you're thinking about spare parts, it informs what that's going to look like, what the Mars mission is going to look like with the parts you need and then the number and the types of spare parts that you also have to consider when you're thinking about a Mars mission.  Chel Stromgren: Correct.  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: And then we have to get really creative, right? Because again, you know, we can't just bring a warehouse full of spare parts.  Host: Right.  Chel Stromgren: So, we have to start to get really smart in how we do things. And one of the big differences I'm sure we're going to see on a Mars mission is the astronauts are going to have to repair equipment down at a lower level. You know, in ISS, although you know obviously, spaceflight even to LEO [Low-Earth Orbit] is expensive, compared to going to Mars, it's relatively cheap. You know, most of the time we have the space shuttle and now we have other vehicles. So, in ISS, because they wanted to maximize the amount of time available for science, they repair things at a very high level. If something failed, they would essentially replace the entire box, right, no matter what failed within it. That's not an approach that's going to work with Mars because the mass of all those giant spares would be too high. So, the astronauts are going to have to start repairing things at a much lower level. They're going to have to start tearing down equipment. Like instead of replacing the entire dishwasher, they're going to have to go in and find the one part that failed and fix that part because, you know, from a mass perspective that's going to be way more efficient. But it's going to put way more of a burden on the astronauts because they're going to have to become, you know, essentially repairmen in space.  Host: I was going to say, for International Space Station training, they've forgone a lot of that system level maintenance that we saw a lot in the Gemini days and Mercury days, even Apollo days of fixing those tiny little components, knowing the guts of the spacecraft and some of those systems from the inside out. Space station training has evolved to really, like you're saying, just basic stuff. You know, if this breaks, swap this part. You've got this thing over here. And they try to make it, as you're saying, as easy as possible because the mission on the space station right now is science.  Chel Stromgren: Correct. To the point where they put quick disconnects on things. Right?  Host: Yes.  Chel Stromgren: They want to make it so easy that they'll set up five quick disconnects. You're absolutely right. The astronauts, because they shouldn't on ISS, they don't have to know how a specific piece of equipment works. They have to know the five plugs and disconnects they have to undo to replace that entire unit. Then it'll get disposed of and they'll just install a whole new unit. But you're absolutely right, they astronauts who go to Mars are going to have to have an intimate knowledge of those systems, so they can go in and replace an individual pump or an individual valve if it fails.  Host: Wow. Now in terms of the supply, you know, we're talking about a Mars mission and the analogy is so perfect of thinking about a car packed with three years of stuff. But I'm thinking about a Mars mission and it's maybe not as closed as that. I'm trying to think of opportunities where there might be little stations or places where you can resupply stuff. I'm thinking you could stage stuff in Mars' orbit. You can stage stuff on the surface of Mars. All ahead of time so maybe you can pick it up on the way and you don't need to necessarily bring your car or pack that Mars transit vehicle, you don't have to pack it full of three years of stuff. You can stage stuff ahead of time. Is that a consideration?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. So, we're definitely looking at that. Let's talk about the surface first.  Host: Sure.  Chel Stromgren: Because you're absolutely right. I mean, obviously, you know, everything that goes to the surface, we're going to preposition. Right? It wouldn't make any sense for the astronauts who are traveling to Mars to take everything they need on the surface with them. So almost certainly, you know, there will be landers that go down to the surface that precede the crew that will carry the things they need on the surface. And that's all the stuff we've talked about, the food, the water, the, you know, the EVA suits. And it'll also include all the stuff they want to use to explore the surface, the science, the rovers, things like that. So, you're absolutely right. On the surface we will almost certainly preposition everything we need there. Although that does come with its own challenges, right? Because now you're talking about sending things out years ahead of time, you know, and making sure that they have a very high reliability of working for the first time the humans touch them after three years of traveling through space. But going back to the other analogy, so for the in-space duration of the humans traveling to Mars and could we position things like in Mars' orbit to be picked up? And certainly, that's an option and it would have huge advantages in terms of propulsion. Right? Because we could send all that stuff out on a nice slow transit ahead of time, low energy, you know, it would cut down on the prop requirements. And then we could minimize, you know, the mass of that crewed vehicle, which we want to go as fast as possible. But there are challenges there certainly from a risk standpoint because now if you think about it, I'm heading out to Mars and if anything happens to that cache, if for some reason I can't dock with that cache, now I don't have enough food to get home. So, you know, we are looking at those options, but it is a pretty significant risk trade to try to take that. You know, even if a case happened where we couldn't break into Mars' orbit, if we have all those supplies with us, there are often abort trajectories we can take. Right? We can alter the trajectory, head back to Earth, potentially without even going into Mars' orbit. But now if all that stuff is prepositioned, now it's a mission critical step that I have to be able to stop, dock, and get all that stuff, or I'm not coming home.  Host: Yeah. That is a big risk that you're introducing now. Yeah, you're right.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah.  Host: Anything can fail. That far away, anything could happen.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: And that's something you really have to consider for a Mars mission. What happens if, you know, you can't dock, or something happens where it doesn't line up the right way or you know? I'm trying to think of every possible scenario and yeah. That almost makes you want to, if you were packing this vehicle, pack it with just enough where if you couldn't dock for whatever reason, you can get home on rations maybe. But then the resupply vehicle would be nice to have. Man, it's got to be a nightmare inside your head trying to think of everything.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. Correct. And an interesting one is kind of on the flipside of the coin, another way that we can reduce mass that we also study as part of this is trash. So, you know, it's kind of the heads and tails of the logistics world. We consume all these things that I'm talking about. At the same time, we're producing a lot of trash. And trash is a great way to reduce the mass of the crewed vehicle during the mission because what we don't want to do is, we don't want to keep all that trash onboard. We want to find ways to get rid of that trash as the mission's going on, so our vehicle is getting lighter and lighter. So, as the humans are generating trash, as we're using parts and producing spares, as we're producing waste gases and waste waters--I'm sure you're aware of the regenerative ECLSS [Environmental Control and Life Support System]. We want to recycle as much as possible so we can produce clean water or clean oxygen from our own waste products. But then things we can't recycle, we want to use either something like a trash airlock or a trash burning system to get rid of that stuff as quickly as we can and bring that spacecraft mass down. So that's the other side of our job is looking at, you know, not only how do we supply it, but how do we get rid of it once we've used it.  Host: Yeah that is a big consideration there too. I guess that's a benefit right there. You can kind of lose some of the mass, but it also is a consideration you have. I'm trying to think of other challenges along the way. One other thing that comes to mind is just the stuff you have. Right? Three years\u2019 worth of stuff. Some of the hardware I think would be OK, but not everything can last three years. Right? I mean, I'm trying to think of just the food I have in my pantry.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: Only a few things I can think of really will last three years.  Chel Stromgren: That's true. And that is a huge challenge that NASA's working on. And you're absolutely right. I mean, you know, it's easy to react and say, \"Oh I can go down to REI and buy, you know, camping food that has an expiration date of, you know, 2035 on it.\" And while that's true, you can't live on that stuff for three years. Right? Because what happens is although, you know, it may be shelf stable for that long, the nutrients start to break down. And that food that is shelf stable for that long doesn't provide a full spectrum of nutrition. So, it is a balance. And what's interesting and very different from the space station is, you know, as part of these Mars mission that the [Mars Integration Group] MIG is planning right now, we're assuming that up to 50% of the food is frozen.  Host: Wow.  Chel Stromgren: And we have never used frozen food or even really refrigerated food to any serious extent in space before. So that's going to mean a whole new system on these spacecraft. I mean, we simply need to do that, well for two reasons. One is to keep enough nutrients in the food for that long and to keep this food, you know, edible and stable for that long, but frankly also just from a palatability perspective. You know, even on ISS the space food isn't--they put up with it for six months. They're astronauts. They're tough. But what we find is, you know, a lot of times many astronauts don't eat as much as they should. It's just not really that appetizing to a lot of the astronauts. So, you know, the goal is, you know, by using a higher percentage of frozen foods, you know, which is essentially, you know, once it's thawed out fresh food, you know, you can make it a little more appetizing, certainly more nutritious, and hopefully have a better profile for the astronauts over time.  Host: That's big. And also, I mean one of the things I'm thinking of is now you have a bunch of freezers carrying half the food for your mission. That's a lot of energy too.  Chel Stromgren: It's a lot of energy. It's a lot of mass. But, you know, one thing we've got at NASA is smart engineers. And they're starting to figure out how to use things like, you know, heat pipes out to space. So, let's use the cold of space to, you know, run the freezer instead of having to have, you know, a Freon system like you would in your house. So, I'm confident that, you know, those guys, the engineers who design that stuff can come up with a great freezer at a really low mass. And, you know, there may be ways to use those freezers on the way home. So, you know, as they get empty and we have, you know, frozen core samples from Mars, maybe we can put those frozen core samples into those very same freezers to get them back to Earth.  Host: Now, one more challenge I'm thinking of in terms of a Mars mission, and this is a little different because you've been referencing the International Space Station, which is a fantastic model. I think what changes, one of the main things at least for me that changes, is the environment. Now you're introducing a lot more radiation and possible environmental challenges on that transit. How does that inform what you pack?  Chel Stromgren: It is a major factor in a couple of different ways. And one of the biggest ones goes back to a topic I referenced before, which is the reliability of systems. You know, like it or not, most of our spacecraft systems are turning into electronic systems, you know, software controlled, certainly process controllers. And one of the big concerns we have is that, you know, as I move out of the Van Allen Belt and I'm in this much more severe radiation environment, is that we're going to see a lot more failures in that type of equipment. You know, we kind of know that from past experience, although we don't have a ton of empirical data on how that happens. And frankly that's one reason, you know, we want to leverage the lunar gateway so that we can start to get experience putting some of those systems outside of the Van Allen Belt, begin to understand what the failure rates might look like, so we can better plan for those failures and frankly design better systems, more radiation hardened systems, so we can protect against those type of failures when we go to Mars. You know, another way radiation can impact what we pack is we need to provide radiation protection for the astronauts, you know, both from background cosmic radiation, but if there's a solar event during the mission we already know we're going to have to have some kind of solar storm shelter that the astronauts can go down if there is a solar particle event during the mission. And one way to provide that, you know, is to use the logistics we already have. If we have a bunch of water, if we have a bunch of bags packed with food and spare parts, we can arrange those logistics in a way that, you know, they can form a fairly substantial radiation shelter for the crew. So, you know, when we're talking about packing the spacecraft, it's not only fitting it in, the radiation guys are doing their, you know, 3D radiation modeling to try to help us position all those logistics, you know, particularly around things like the crew quarters, so we can get that safe haven.  Host: That's going to be very, very important. This will blend into our next topic real nicely. We talked about a lot of the challenges that are facing us on this journey to Mars. Now and you've already alluded to a lot of them, but let's go through this packing list here. We've already talked about food and, you know, half of it being frozen. We've talked about the radiation shelter. That's something you absolutely have to have onboard. Let's talk about, you alluded to this one, the regenerative life support. Now what's that going to look like?  Chel Stromgren: Sure. It's one of my favorite topics. So, you know, of all the advances we've made on ISS in terms of, you know, designing spacecraft, I think one of the biggest ones is what we call regenerative ECLSS and it's kind of a fancy name for saying recycling. So, you know, one of the biggest needs that humans have to keep alive in terms of mass is oxygen and water, right? We consume a huge amount of oxygen and water. And those are also very difficult things, they're heavy things to deliver into space. So, we certainly don't want to go to Mars carrying in tanks all the water and oxygen we would need to get the whole way. It would be tens of thousands of kilograms of extra mass we would have to push. So, what a regenerative ECLSS does is it takes the human waste products and essentially, either through filters or through chemical processes, recycles them so we can use them again. We sweat, we perspire. These systems will take that humidity out of the air. It'll take our urine and it'll put it through a series of advanced filters and chemical processes and produce clean potable water. Similarly, as we exhale and we produce carbon dioxide, we can collect that carbon dioxide, put it through a chemical process called a Sabatier, and it also produces clean water. And then finally, we can take that clean water, put it through an electrolysis system, and that gives us fresh oxygen. So, it's this complete cycle of taking these waste products and running them through these various processes and at the end we get clean water and oxygen out of it. And we can basically do that to such an extent that we don't have to carry really any additional oxygen and water. We get a little water through the food we consume and through metabolic processes and by doing this recycling we can make up the difference. So actually, when we leave for Mars, and I mean we'll have a safety store of oxygen and water, but we basically bring no additional oxygen and water. We recycle that the whole way there and back.  Host: That is huge. I mean, that's a lot of mass you're saving right there.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. It really makes the mission possible in my opinion.  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: It simply wouldn't be viable to push that much. And then, you know, joined into that we're also looking at things we can do on the surface to supply new water. You may have heard the term ISRU, In-Situ Resource Utilization. So, when we get there, we're pretty sure there is water on Mars, so you know for the surface we're starting to do experiments now. In fact, the next Mars lander is going to have a test experiment of this. We want to be able to take, you know, gases out of the atmosphere, we want to be able to take water out of the ground, clean that, and use that on the surface. Because again, you know the gear ratio is even higher to get to the surface. We don't want to land any water or oxygen or as little as possible on the surface. So, if we can get to Mars and, to violate the initial analogy, actually stop and pick up some supplies at Mars, that certainly helps a lot as well.  Host: Alright. Yeah. That is really limiting the amount of I guess water and all of those consumables that you need for that mission. That is huge.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. And, you know, really if you talk to anybody about space exploration, it's really the key to opening up the solar system. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: Humans have got to learn to live away from Earth. We're not going to be able to continue to bring everything with us we ever need. That's simply not sustainable. So, the more we can recycle, the more we can make use of those type of products that we find along our way, the easier we're going to be able to get further and further out into the solar system.  Host: Now on this topic of recycling, this is one that I'm extremely curious about because I know how they do it on the International Space Station, their clothes. I know they only wear them for a very specific period of time, and it changes with their daily clothes versus their workout clothes. But they trash it. They only wear it for a little bit and then they trash it. So, what are we thinking about for Mars?  Chel Stromgren: We're exploring various different ideas. You know, frankly that may be the way that we go forward. Although we're getting better at it. What you're referring to on the ISS is they're starting to use this new advanced type of clothing that has silver impregnated to it. Silver is a natural biocide, so it's going to kill those things that come out in your sweat that start to cause things like smell. So, you can wear a pair of silver impregnated t-shirts for weeks and it really doesn't get stinky. So that helps a lot. So, you know, we're not talking about, you know, having to bring a new shirt every day. It's maybe a new shirt for every couple of weeks. But to go further, you're absolutely right. We'd like to avoid that all together. And NASA does have some programs that are starting to look at a space laundry. You know, we'd certainly like to be able to do that, to bring a couple set of clothes that can last three years and just to clean them as we go along. But there are some pretty huge challenges there. One is, you know, any type of water based laundry gets really difficult because again, you know, now although as we discussed with this regenerative ECLSS we could probably recycle that water but it makes the amount of water you need for a laundry is really large. So, it would make those systems much, much bigger. And, you know, there's problems with the surfactants, you know, the type of things that are in laundry detergent that make them work, make the water much harder to recycle. But there's some really good ideas that are being looked at. I know NASA's looking at microwave-based laundry cleaners, things that expose the clothes to the vacuum of space to try to clean them. So, we'll continue to look at those things and we'll really try to hammer that clothing mass as well. Because you're right, it does seem crazy to, you know, bring three years\u2019 worth of clothing and then just toss them out as we're going along.  Host: Right. Yeah. And if you have that ability to wash it or I guess disinfect it, that's an interesting idea to microwave or expose it to vacuum. Yeah, just the idea to clean it, that really limits the amount of clothes, number of clothes you really have to bring so that's awesome.  Chel Stromgren: Yep. Yeah. Yeah. So that's one of the many technologies we're going to push to try to reduce that logistics mass.  Host: Now, OK other things you need to pack aboard, obviously, you know, one of the main things you need for any trip is hygiene and care items, your toothbrush, your toothpaste. Now you're talking about maybe toothpaste that's got to last for three years. Any unique considerations there?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. Hygiene supplies and even clothing to some extent get interesting because people have such personal preferences, right? You know, for a lot of the stuff we send into space, you know, NASA has their standard NASA issue items. But particularly when it comes to hygiene supplies, you know, people like very specific things. So actually, NASA has a fairly advanced process to qualify items. And even on ISS there's a whole catalog of items that astronauts are allowed to choose from, and they do get to choose. They have a mass allocation and the astronauts, before they go up to ISS, get to go through and, you know, say, \"I'd like that shampoo and that deodorant, and I like this toothbrush and this flavor toothpaste.\" And to the extent that they can be accommodated, they can even ask for additional things to be put on that list. So if there is a very specific type of moisturizer that the astronaut really wants to have, as long as it's not too challenging, it can be qualified, you know, making sure it's not flammable, that it's not going to be a problem in the ISS atmosphere, and then that can be added to that catalog. So, it's a little thing. You know, it ends up being very complex because we have to go through this qualification process, but, you know, I personally think it's absolutely critical to the astronaut's kind of wellbeing. Right? The little things like that, you know, being able to have something that they're used to using at home, takes away or helps to take away a little bit of the stress from these long spaceflights. So, we want to absolutely accommodate that type of thing as much as possible. So, you might have different astronauts with an entirely different hygiene kit, you know, kind of depending on what their preferences are.  Host: Alright. Yeah, that's very similar. And I know those hygiene items, just from talking to some hygiene folks on this podcast actually, I got to understand that some of those hygiene items that are on that list are approved for that ECLSS system so it's not going to affect it in any way.  Chel Stromgren: That's right. And that's part of that testing I was talking about.  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: You know, any spacecraft like this, particularly when we're talking about regenerative ECLSS is an incredibly complex, you know, closed biosphere. So, you know, it's tough to imagine the downstream effects, you know, just if somebody has a new spray on deodorant that has some kind of chemical in it, you don't ever know how that's going to get brought into the ECLSS system. It could start to foul filters. It could start to cause problems later on. So, there is an awful lot of analysis that has to take place to make sure that, you know, anything we bring is really benign. And as you said, on ISS it would be bad enough if it could cause problems, but you know on Mars if you weren't really careful about that, and those systems failed, you know, that could be deadly. So, it is an incredibly intense process to make sure that everything is all compatible.  Host: Now, we're talking about a lot of things you need to bring, your classic road trip sort of things, but we are going to be on this vehicle and that vehicle needs to have certain capabilities for the people inside. And I know one of the top considerations, and this is a big one even for International Space Station, is exercise equipment. What are we thinking?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. Exercise equipment is a huge challenge for various reasons. One is, you know, exercise is not only, you know, just to stay in shape, it's one of our primary kinds of medical counter measures. Right? So, you know, one of the big challenges we face in general is these long periods in zero gravity or micro gravity conditions. And we're starting to understand a lot more from our research on ISS how that can cause problems for the health of the astronauts. And, you know, one of the best ways we have to counter that is for the astronauts to do exercise. So, it's not only kind of yeah, we need to keep you in cardiovascular shape, for all those things like bone loss and things like that, the exercise helps with things like that. So, in fact, we anticipate doing even more exercise on these Mars missions than they do on ISS now. And they're already doing a lot of exercise on ISS. So, we want to make sure we have systems that absolutely maximize that value. So, NASA's actually doing kind of a test right now for the next generation of exercise system. On ISS, you know, right now we have various treadmills that they use, they have bicycle ergometers that they use, and then they have resistive devices, which, you know, kind of simulates weightlifting, that type of thing. NASA's looking at systems that really start to maximize that and combine those functions more like in a universal machine. You can do more different types of varied exercises, you know, so they get around the boredom, exercise for muscles, so they're more effective. So, we hope once these tests are done that, we'll get an exercise system that not only is way more effective but weighs a lot less. One of the big problems we have with exercise systems is the isolation, you know, isolation from the systems. You know, you can imagine a treadmill creates a huge pounding force that can essentially, you know, in something like a space station could rattle the entire thing if it wasn't very isolated. So, we not only have this big complex treadmill, we have to have this very complex isolation system, so those forces don't get in. But now as we're moving forward, we can design things, you know, more advanced systems, you know, better analysis. We hope to be able to get those systems much smaller, much lighter, but again, be much more effective.  Host: Yeah, that'll be big, combining all of those things and making them smaller. Big challenge definitely ahead of you.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: The other one is, and this one I know just from not only the space station, but we have something here called [Human Exploration Research Analog] HERA where they simulate long duration missions and basically the human element of living together. This makes me think of living areas and sleeping areas. So, what are we thinking for a Mars transit vehicle?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. And again, like so many of the things we've discussed, it's this balance. Right? You know, there's a desire from, you know, the propulsion guys to make things as small and compact as possible, but from a human health and human, you know, wellbeing side, we have to make sure that the astronauts, you know, are well taken care of. So, you know, we take things like sleeping spaces, personal quarters. You know, obviously the most efficient way would just to be have, you know, one space that's, you know, they'd just sleep wherever they are. They all sleep together. We don't have to have private rooms. But, you know, you can imagine on a three-year stressful journey that's simply not going to cut it. So, we know that the astronauts are going to have to have their own sleeping space. And a space that they can go to for privacy, right? Sometimes they're just going to need to get away from everything. Maybe they want to go watch a movie or they want to, you know, record a message for their family. So, you know, what we anticipate for this Mars spacecraft is it may be a little more sumptuous than we're seeing on ISS. You know, each astronaut's likely to have their own little cubicle. And look, it's not going to be the Ritz, but, you know, it'll be enough space where they can, you know, not only lie down, they might have a bench in there where they can sit, again read a book, with a closing door, with some acoustic insulation where they can really just get, you know, that time alone that they need. On the other side, we also need to encourage socialization. Right? We don't want people, you know, just working all the time and then going off on their own. So, we're also planning spaces where they can play games. You know, they will definitely have some kind of war table where they can sit and have meals, where they can play a card game if they want. We're trying to make sure that they have enough open space that they could play a ball game or something. Right? We saw this on Skylab where they were very innovative. They ended up using a ring of lockers as a track that they could run around. We saw that they used that open space to play catch. We think things like that are very important. You know, that just downtime, relaxation. We really want there to be at least one big open space. We want there to be a place where they can sit down and watch a movie together. So, there'll probably be a space where they can sit down with a large screen, you know, with enough places that they can all sit there as a crew and spend time together and watch a movie if they want. So again, very carefully balancing that need to keep things as small and tight as possible with keeping the crew healthy. And a lot of that is just going to be through smart reuse of spaces. Right? You know, we've got to have spaces that are reconfigurable. So, you know, the place where they exercise during the day, you know, we want those exercise systems to be able to fold away. So maybe that's the same place they can all sit and watch a movie at night.  Host: Interesting. OK. Yeah, they have their own personal space to do these activities, but it can be interchanged. Very interesting.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: I know another one is I'm going back to food here for a second. But you did mention a lot of frozen food. I know there's been experiments on the space station for growing plants and even recently they were able to eat some lettuce. So, is there any thoughts about adding possibly a farm for some fresh grown food on the way?  Chel Stromgren: We would love to get there. You know, the advantage to that would be huge again, just from a nutrition standpoint and a psychological standpoint. But there are some pretty significant challenges.  Host: Sure.  Chel Stromgren: You know, growing, you know, although with new aquacultures and things we're getting better about water usage, growing plants does require additional water in the cycle. Now again, we can, by using our regenerative systems, we can recover a lot of that water. So, it may not be a huge burden, but it does make those systems more complex. The other challenge is again, you know, similar to that caching we talked about before is just the risk. You know, if you are depending on those plants growing and something happens, you know you get a system failure, the plants die, you get some blight or disease in there, now you don't have enough food. So, my guess is, you know, at least initially we're probably not going to have, we're not going to depend on those foods. I think we'll still do it. We'll grow lettuce. We'll grow cucumbers onboard. But it'll be more for variety than replacing, you know, the other food we need to bring.  Host: Got it. OK. Now, of course there's, you know, we're talking about things to do. Right? We're talking about their exercise, their gaming time, and just movie time. They're going to have a lot of time to kill here on that nine months. So, I'm sure some of it is going to be dedicated to science and experiments.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. So that's an interesting analysis. The MIG is doing a lot of crew time analysis to see what the crew might be doing during that journey. We will make free time for science. I don't want to imply that we won't. But to some extent, you know, I don't think the crew's going to be sitting around looking for things to do. You know, we discussed before on ISS we went to this repair concept where we just swap out big boxes, specifically so that we can create crew time to do science. And that on the Mars vehicle, because of mass reasons, the crew will be doing a lot more detailed repair. So, you know, one thing we anticipate is that the crew's going to be spending a significant portion of time just maintaining the spacecraft because things will fail. I mean, we know that. Things fail all the time on ISS and the crew repairs them. So, the crew will spend, you know, some time, \"Hey, you know, we've got to replace this pump. We know it's about to fail.\" And there will be a lot of routine maintenance. You know, there's a lot of filters, smoke detectors, things like that are going to have to be replaced. So, there will be a chunk of time doing that. But we will make sure there's time to do science. So, we will put capabilities in place to do some experiments as we go along. And it'll be a unique opportunity, right? Because although we may do some longer missions before then, it'll probably be the first time that humans spend three years in space. So, a lot of those will be human experiments really upon themselves, measuring their own condition, their own, you know, neuromotor function, and things like that just so we can monitor how they're doing as they go along. But there'll be other things. You know, this will be, even when we're in orbit around Mars before we go to the surface, it'll be the closest humans have been. So, we'll take that opportunity to survey the surface, to do things like that. So, there'll be a lot of, you know, we want to maximize the value of the time, both when we're at Mars and on the way there. So, we'll make sure that they're doing the right things.  Host: Absolutely.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah.  Host: Absolutely. Now, we're at Mars. This brings up another thought just on the idea of packing. And we've talked a lot about just on the way to Mars things you have to have onboard with you. You did mention at one point when we were talking about the In-Situ Resource Utilization, the ability to have consumables onboard. And that makes me think of picking up stuff on that stop you're making at Mars, whether it's on the surface or otherwise for that surface mission, pre staging more stuff to stock up on for the way back home, maybe extra clothes, maybe extra spare parts that you're putting on the surface of Mars. Is that a consideration or is that a little bit farfetched?  Chel Stromgren: Probably not on the surface because, you know, you wouldn't want to put things on the surface that you wanted to use in space just because, you know, the hardest thing we do in spaceflight is getting off the surface, whether it's Earth or Mars or wherever, right? That's the highest energy. So, you know, we wouldn't want to put stuff on the surface because the amount of propellant we would have to put on the surface also to get that back up to orbit again would be crazy. But again, we discussed a little bit before, caching, you know, in Mars' orbit, you know, that's something we definitely need to investigate. And you're right, you know, maybe you can do it in a way that's smart and reduces the risk. You're right. I may want to have enough contingency food that I could limp back home if I didn't make that rendezvous. But, you know, I might be willing to risk having stinky clothes. I might be willing to risk that, you know, I don't have my full 50% of frozen food on the way home. So, in that case, you know, I could kind of split the difference and say, \"OK well I'm going to put some of this stuff pre-positioned in Mars' orbit in a logistics module. I think I can still get home if I miss that rendezvous, but under normal operations I would make that rendezvous, restock everything, you know, get new food in, new clothes, pack all my trash in a logistics module and continue the mission.\" And that may be a good way to kind of, yeah like so many things, a nice compromise to, yeah, I'm not pushing all this mass, but I'm not endangering the crew if I'm not able to make that rendezvous.  Host: This is absolutely fascinating. Now I'm thinking about the short term here because we talked this whole time about a Mars mission, and you talked about this right in the very beginning and it excited me because we actually just did an episode on the Gateway.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: But I feel like there's so much from Gateway that we can learn, whether it's systems, whether it's operations, what have you, while this thing is around the Moon that can inform what you pack on this Mars transit vehicle. So, what else? What is the full scope of things that you're excited about for Gateway?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. So, I'm actually a big fan of Gateway and I think it provides a lot of things for NASA as we move forward. One is, you know, and people I think don't realize this, just the value of it being a pit stop. A place, you know, because I am a logistic centric guy, a place where you can collect logistics. So, when we're doing these missions in the future, and it won't just be a mission to Mars. You know, we might precede that with a Venus fly-by. We might precede that with just, you know, a long mission around Earth and solar space to test things out. We don't have to be able to deliver everything directly to the spacecraft we're going to use for those missions, because often that can be time sensitive. Right? We can use Gateway as a warehouse, in fact, to build up logistics over a number of years before we have to depart. So, you know, you're probably aware that there's this new Gateway logistics service where we're going to hire private companies to deliver logistics to Gateway. Essentially what we can do is we can take advantage of that every year, collect the logistics we need for these longer missions like the Mars missions at Gateway, stage them there, and then launch that spacecraft empty. Again, much easier to launch when it's empty, and then load all those logistics from Gateway when we're ready to go. So that in itself operationally is just a huge thing. That's the same reason we want to run the HLS missions to the Moon out of Gateway. We don't want to have to launch everything we need to go to the Moon with that lunar lander, because that's very heavy. Right? So, things like the food they're going to consume on the surface, the EVA suits they're going to use on the surface. It's much better for us to launch that via this unmanned vehicle to Gateway, meet the lunar lander there, and then load that stuff in there so we can go down to the surface. Again, so operationally I think Gateway makes stuff a lot easier. But it's also, you know, I said before how ISS is the best possible experiment. Well, Gateway is gen two of that best possible experiment. So, you know, although ISS is mature and sometimes hard to put new capabilities, we can put those new capabilities into Gateway and test them there. And again, now we're beyond the Van Allen Belt, so it's a more analogous environment to what we're going to see going to Mars or Venus or somewhere. So, when we start looking at things like the radiation impacts, the deep space impacts, even things like communication delay, because we can certainly talk about that because that's another huge operational issue, the Gateway is a better analog than even ISS. So, we can get closer and closer to the actual mission, test things in that relevant environment, and make sure they really work.  Host: Yeah. Let's investigate that for a little bit, that communication delay. Does that impact what you have to pack onboard or I guess the operations along the way as well?  Chel Stromgren: To some extent it impacts both. So, you know, we know that the astronauts are going to have to be more autonomous. You know, if anybody's kind of seen ISS operations, the astronauts get a ton of support from ground control. You know, they always have the experts standing by in ground control and certain things like when they're doing repairs, they have somebody constantly talking in their ear. Right? So, the astronaut, you know, may not have to have read the entire manual. They've got the guy with the manual on the ground who can say, \"If you look three inches to your right, you'll see the right wire. Now, turn it a quarter turn counterclockwise.\" The further away you get from Earth, the harder that operating mode gets. Right? Until you get to Mars where, you know, the roundtrip can be, you know, almost an hour. So, you can't sit there and say, \"Oh, do I cut the red wire or the blue wire?\" And then wait for an hour to learn the answer. So, to some extent, the astronauts are going to have to be more self-sufficient in doing everything, you know, running the spacecraft, controlling their own lives, certainly in things like doing repair and doing science. And that puts a lot more burden on the astronaut, but it also requires new systems. And a lot of those are going to be training systems. NASA's going to have to develop systems that train the astronauts to do specific tasks during the mission. Because they have human limits, right? I think James Michener wrote that, you know, the Apollo astronauts learned as much as the human memory could possibly take about that spacecraft. They simply couldn't have learned anymore about the Apollo spacecraft because it was so complex. The Mars spacecraft is going to be ten times more complex than that, so they simply won't be able to know everything. But, you know, if they're about to do a specific repair, they have to repair the water processor, what we want to be able to do is have remote training, which includes maybe 3D interactive training onboard, so prior to doing that repair then they can become experts on that specific repair they need to make. So, you know, maybe they can virtually repair it ahead of time. They can get the knowledge from the experts on the ground so that when they go to repair that water processor and they have that one-hour communication delay they can still proceed reasonably well, and they can be expert enough to effectively execute that repair. And that's going to be a huge challenge, you know, just being able to do things without constantly checking back with ground control.  Host: Now, let's Chel, let's play king for a day. I'm going to go back to Gateway here for a second. And the reason I want to focus on that is because that's coming up here in the near term. We're talking the next few years having the Gateway as this test bed to figure out what we're going to need for a Mars mission. So if you were king for a day, what were some of those things that you would have the astronauts do that you would put on Gateway that you want to verify to make sure that everything you're thinking for packing for a Mars mission is going to work when we actually make that Mars transit vehicle?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah, so there's various things that we're talking about doing on Gateway. You know, one of them, and it'll be a combined ISS and Gateway, but again, the next generation of ECLSS system. We talked about ECLSS a lot in the past. The ECLSS community is constantly trying to improve those systems based on lessons learned on ISS, trying to make them more efficient, so we can close that loop even more, you know, recover more water and oxygen. But, because we depend on those things so much, we have to make sure they're reliable in space. So, to me it's absolutely critical that we get those things on ISS first and then on to Gateway, again because of the different environment, because of the isolation, because of the radiation. We need to test those in both analog environments and get as much run time as possible. Because it's not just getting up there and making sure they work. It's getting them running for a long enough time that we start to understand the reliability and the failure rates. And that's true for all these systems. You know, we're going to have advanced communication systems. We're going to have advanced avionics. We're going to have advanced thermal control systems. You know, from the packing side of me and understanding the reliability and understanding all these repair activities, I want to get as much time in space with and without crew as possible so I can understand those systems as best I can before I leave for Mars. So, to me that's the number one. The number two, you know, is what we just discussed is to start to develop these new types of procedures that allow the astronauts to work more autonomously. I mean, again, you know, we're not talking hour delay when we're at the Moon. We're talking, you know, maybe 12 seconds roundtrip. But that's enough that it breaks that instant chain, right? It's not, you know, like we're talking now where I talk, you answer, I talk, you answer. It's a I've got to compose my thoughts, transmit it, they compose a response, and transmit it. And so even getting as far away as Gateway starts to give us that real world experience of OK, now I have to fix this thing. I'm not going to have instantaneous feedback. So, we can start to test things like autonomous training and start to really understand from a human perspective, you know, how do you teach a guy in this stressful environment who's not an expert on this system to make these types of repairs. So, personally I want to make sure, you know, if we are going to go down at this lower level of repair, that we start to test those kind of things at Gateway so we can, you know, really understand how to train the astronauts to do them in space.  Host: You know what's exciting to me, Chel, is just how soon this is going to happen that this is something that's in the very near horizon we're going to be able to test some of these things. And it gets me excited about the Mars mission, which is again, sure in the future, but man this is a new generation we're talking about. What are your feelings about the Artemis mission and going forward, laying that foundation and testing all of these critical things like regenerative life support, making sure that, that's ready for a Mars mission? What excites you the most?  Chel Stromgren: I think what excites me the most is you can kind of tell the atmosphere around NASA has changed a little bit. You said something interesting. You said this Mars mission's off in the future. And the whole time I've been working for NASA, you know, the Mars mission was always 20 years away. Didn't matter when you were, it was 20 years away. You know, we were always kind of focused, well we're focused on ISS and we're focused on SLS and Orion. The difference in the last few years is, you know, although we are focused on HLS and Gateway, there's a much more of a feeling of this is really leading to an actual Mars mission. And I think a large part of that is the establishment of the MIG. You know, the MIG is not designing, you know, a Mars mission, you know, theoretically that could happen sometime in the future. They are designing, you know, the Mars mission we think we can actually execute in the 2030s. And then they are working backwards from there to define exactly what capabilities need to be developed. And then we are absolutely trying to make sure that the development of those capabilities get incorporated in what we're doing in ISS, Gateway, and HLS. So, there may be aspects of HLS that are done not because they're optimal for HLS, but simply because they support this future Mars mission. Because we don't want to get stuck in this 20 year away paradigm. We want to start working through those challenges. So, we're 19, 18, 17 years away and we actually can get there.  Host: That is big. Chel, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. This was so fascinating to just hear all of the stuff you need to consider for a Mars mission. And then what's really exciting to me is we're going to be testing a lot of those things in the very near future and getting a good foundation. And you're going to see the hardware that's going to come up and is going to really make that Mars mission, as you're saying, more of a realistic thing. Man, that you can actually put your eyes on it. Wow, this is something that we can actually use for Mars. Very, very exciting stuff. Chel Stromgren, thank you for coming on today.  Chel Stromgren: Oh, thank you. It was great. Hey, it's great that people can understand a little bit more about some of these challenges.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really fascinating conversation we had with Chel Stromgren today about what to pack for Mars. I really hope you're enjoying our Mars Monthly episodes that we've been doing here on Houston We Have a Podcast. This is the fifth in our series. You can go back and listen to them in order or not, up to you. The last one we did was 156 with Paul Kessler about the Deep Space Transport. Another one I would suggest is 157 where we talked to Dan Hartman and Lara Kearney about the Gateway. We made a lot of comparisons to Gateway during today's episode, so if you want to know more about that vehicle, go ahead and check out that episode or any of our I guess, 160 episodes that we've done of Houston We Have a Podcast. You can check us out at NASA.gov/podcasts. Click on us, Houston We Have a Podcast, or the many other podcasts we have across NASA.
